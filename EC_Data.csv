"On the liquidity portfolio, we have been buying some short-term and medium-term notes, matching the maturity around the TLTRO disposal.",0
"Obviously, we have rates at short-term rates below zero, difficult for the traditional banking business, but thanks to our insurance and asset management franchise, which now this year overtakes the contribution that the banking business produces, so 42% coming from insurance and asset management versus 36% for the banking business.",0
"The reputation of the company in terms of quality of service, quality of risk, and the capacity to jump into big, big deals has been the key driver in order to have an agreement with Telef√≥nica, which meant that our consumer finance company was the company in charge of bringing consumer finance to all those clients that were going to buy a new package that Telef√≥nica has brought into the market through its 2,000 Movistar points of sale.",0
We have reached the 8.3% fully loaded as of September compared to our objective of being above 8% for December.,0
"So, we have been able to jump onto the Banco de Valencia merger and have full IT integration completed in July.",1
"On the loan book, the situation is, I would say, the same in terms of the trend of improvement but very different because here what we are coming is from negative figures into stabilization.",1
"The reality is as of now we already have a return on intangible equity in line with our strategic plan and the real-estate losses which you have in implementation, that we have provided, are partially offset with the results from our investment portfolio meaning that the ‚Ç¨1.1 billion of net income from banking and insurance comes down to the ‚Ç¨700 million net income that we have actually published today.",-1
"If we look at the composition of profitability by our three segments, comparing last year with this year, we had the impact of Barclays and associated write-offs.",1
Average interest earning assets fell in the quarter as a result of both lower cash balances and a seasonal reduction in loan balances.,-1
"In addition, rep and warranty and litigation continue to be a significant source of uncertainty for the industry, and Capital One is no exception.",-1
"Ending loans were down about 7% from the fourth quarter, driven by expected seasonal pay downs and continuing planned run-off.",-1
On a continuing operation basis we earned a $1.94 per share and have return on average tangible common equity of 15.7%.,0
"As a reminder, all else equal, seasonality results in increasing charge-off rate in the fourth quarter, rising to peak charge-off rate in the first quarter.",0
"Lastly, we had a $4 million release in Reserves in our Commercial Banking segment as we released Reserves associated with loans that moved to charge-offs, which was partially offset by Reserve builds primarily focused in our Taxi Medallion business.",0
"And it was up 15 basis points on a year-over-year basis, fueled by strong growth in our Domestic Card business and higher rates.",1
"Provision for credit losses was down from the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily as the result of the smaller allowance build.",1
We are focused on delivering a differentiated customer experience and we continue to receive external reorganization that indicates we are trending well and that we have good momentum on this.,1
"We continue to gain share, for example, we finished 8th in the national middle market league table volume, that's up a place from 9th in 2013.",1
"So on an underlying basis, we grew NII by 5%, which was driven by attractive earning asset growth with improving mix and our continued efforts to defend the margin despite the impact from a low rate environment on our asset sensitive balance sheet.",1
"We generated an $8 million increase linked quarter in non-interest income, which was driven by gains related to the sale of conforming mortgages and the previously mentioned repositioning of our securities portfolio, which offset the seasonally lower results in other service charges and fee categories.",0
Year-over-year non-interest income increased 8 million from second quarter 2014 in spite of the drag from the Chicago Divestiture of 12 million.,0
"On pages seven and eight, you can see the drivers of our NIM performance this quarter, with one month LIBOR increasing and the continuing mix shift within the retail loan book to more attractive categories, we picked up three basis points on loan yields.",1
The same levers that propelled us from roughly 4% ROTCE to 10% are still in place and the management team has a proven track record of execution.,1
"‚Ç¨12 million will be used to further realign our Corporates & Markets operations, including the streamlining of the securities finance business.",0
"In Fixed Income & Currencies, the overall revenue level is still burdened by the low interest rate environment while in Q4 we have seen improved performance in foreign exchange, thanks to increased market volatility.",-1
"In Commercial Real Estate, a strong decrease of 44% was supported by our ‚Ç¨5.1 billion capital accretive portfolio sales in Spain, Portugal and Japan.",-1
"Finally, we continue to deliver on the non-core rundown and have strengthened our core Tier 1 ratio by 50 basis points.",1
"While we're on track with the strategic realignment in Corporate Clients, the segment successfully on-boarded more than 3,100 net new corporates, since the beginning of 2016.",1
"Year-on-year, we have seen an impressive de-risking of ‚Ç¨36 billion, leading to a sizable net capital relief of ‚Ç¨278 million year-to-date.",1
"Revenues increased by 8%, driven by the net interest income which benefited from active management of interest margins and stable volumes.",1
We have probably been one of the first banks to strictly focus our investment banking activity on the needs and the demands of our clients.,0
Personnel expenses have increased year-over-year by 0.8% with positive effects from staff reduction almost compensating for salary increases and higher costs for retirement provisions on the back of the low interest rate environment.,-1
"The operating result of the Core Bank stands at ‚Ç¨2.3 billion for 2015, translating into an operating return on tangible equity of 12.3%, and a net return on tangible equity of 9.4%.",0
"Q4 2015 operating result was stable compared to the third quarter, thanks to a good treasury result mitigating a seasonally slower December.",1
"We managed to significantly improve the results on all levels as revenues increased, loan loss provisions came down, and the cost base declined.",1
"The group's operating result for the second quarter amounted to ‚Ç¨78 million, after ‚Ç¨469 million in Q1 2013 and ‚Ç¨442 million in Q2 2012.",0
"In terms of the themes business by business, the Retail Bank's 13% cash NPAT growth was a very, very strong result.",1
The other standout feature of this is this is the last time after year-on-year that you'll be seeing this grey bar in this pie chart and for us that is a very significant moment.,0
"And over this period, we completed the acquisition of Take Your Money Everywhere, a technology company, not a bank, which is a world leader in the ability to get regulated bank accounts quickly into the hands of the emerging middle class.",0
"Both sides of the balance sheet outside home loans as well continuing in credit cards, personal loans, so income is up 9%, and the continuing focus on productivity has the cost-to-income ratio down at 36%.",-1
"So, 12 months ago, we had the impact of both Brexit and the Trump effect that led to greater volatility in market.",-1
And you can see here four examples in the period of where the benefits of that focus of productivity is showing up.,1
"If we look at margin, so asset re-pricing, particularly on home loans has improved margin by 3 basis points, but that hasn't been enough to offset the increase in funding costs with deposit costs up 3 basis points and wholesale funding costs up 1 basis point.",1
"So you can see here we replaced that in December with a new a CommBank app that's got new features in it to enable, for example, the sticker on the back to enable contactless payments on the Samsung Galaxy S4, there's the NFC chip allowing the same thing.",1
"We returned to cash generation, as I said in Q2, we generated over $100 million of free cash, pre growth, dividends and the disposal of Tulawaka.",1
"And that set the mine up really well for 2017, and we're starting to see the benefits already in terms of getting back into their high-grade ounces, and I'll show you that on the next slide here.",1
"As you can see we've achieved gold production of 255,000 ounces for the first half of the year, and on track to achieve the top of our guidance range for the year that being 435,000 ounces to 475,000 ounces.",1
"Just finally before we hand over for questions, I just wanted to comment on the two new directors that were announced recently, Rachel English and Steve Lucas who are both London-based directors.",0
"At C&I, where impairments usually fluctuate between quarters, impairments rose during the fourth quarter owing to a couple of large exposures.",-1
"Our insurance subsidiary, Danica, saw net income of more than DKK800 million as a result of higher premiums and an improved result from insurance business.",1
The inflow of new customers gives us a very good platform for substantial cross sell in the medium to long term.,1
"So, well, an okay position for Q1 2013, but obviously, we need to fulfill our targets on all markets as we move forward.",0
"However, this business unit has been affected by a relatively big decline in our net trading income, based on lower activities in the market.",-1
"And some of the details in that are illustrated on page 20, and what is going to happen in practice is, there's going to be discussions between the political parties here during May and June.",0
"The repayment of the state hybrid reduced our capital ratio by 2.7 percentage points, which was partly offset by the new additional Tier 1, which had an effect of 0.6%.",-1
"Then we have launched in Denmark and soon in other markets a Mobile Pay solution, making it as simple to send money person-to-person as it is to send a text message.",0
"On that basis, Danske Bank's Board of Directors is proposing a dividend of DKK 2 per share which represents a payout ratio of 28%.",0
"We saw good progress in lending activity, as volume grew 5% over the level in the first nine months of 2015.",1
"Most of the increase, DKK 12 billion of that, was owing to market risk, partly from the effect of CVA hedging.",0
"Terje Turnes, maybe you should give a few words about the loan losses, which actually is somewhat higher than we saw in the first quarter last year, and we have also updated our guidance related to loan losses.",-1
"Assets under management and custody also show a sound growth in the quarter, and we see a positive inflow both from retail and institutional investors.",1
"Again, out of the almost NOK 1.2 billion we have an impairment there, NOK 834 million of those are related to oil and gas sector.",-1
The declining NPL stock now below ‚Ç¨12 billion and on the back of a stable performing loan book also reduced the NPL ratio from 9.7% to 9.4%.,1
"As you can see, in second and third quarter, almost flat ‚Äì a drop in Romania pretty clear ‚Äì why that happened, and an increase in Slovakia and the rest of the group, all relatively stable.",1
"We also feel very comfortable for the asset quality review, and we see continuation of decline in risk costs over the next quarters into 2014.",-1
Our assumptions for that are continuing to be slightly growing revenues based on the loan growth that we presently see and hopefully falling expenses on a group level.,1
"At the same time, risk weighted assets more or less stable and a further improvement in our NPL ratio from 8.5% down to 8.1%, a development that we hope to see continuing throughout the next quarters.",1
"Same about risk costs, which we expect to end up somewhere in the range of ‚Ç¨1 billion to ‚Ç¨1.2 billion.",1
"And if you look at the ratios, return on equity increased to 11.1% from 8.7% in the first quarter, and return on tangible equity increased from 9.8% in the first quarter to 12.6% in the second.",1
"This is basically explaining the increase on the credit risk weighted asset, and the rest was driven by customer business.",1
That will continue and of course partially due to the fact that we have ‚Äì we moved all our staff from 18 different buildings in Vienna to our new campus.,0
"The net Insurance result in the third quarter amounted to ‚Ç¨109 million compared to ‚Ç¨239 million last year, so a decrease of ‚Ç¨130 million.",-1

"The Non-Life growth in inflows is less spectacular, but all in all, it also grew by almost 10% at constant rate, increasing both in Malaysia and Thailand.",1
"The various actions we took over the year, the capital injection, the stop loss insurance cover and the de-risking of the investment portfolio enabled us to mitigate the effect from Ogden on our solvency ratio, which amounted at the end of 2017 at 147%.",-1
"This is a tough, competitive environment where the focus is clearly on execution and we will continue to drive towards improving performance, where we feel we can do better.",1

"Our goal is to provide solutions for complex, high-transaction industries and segments, such as those businesses in our retail and healthcare verticals and to provide a deeper, more holistic experience to our customers.",0
"With respect to the balance sheet, our total liquid asset stood at ‚Ç¨1.7 billion, of which ‚Ç¨0.8 billion remain ring-fenced for the settlement.",0
"It is ‚Ç¨1.151 billion minus ‚Ç¨1.111 billion plus the paid dividend ‚Ç¨419 million, of which ‚Ç¨526 million for its operational component, which rightfully attracts the most attention.",0
"The tangible net equity is at 90% of the IFRS equity, which shows the strength and the quality of the reported capital.",1
"I think that is more the proof point that the guarantees are not biting, that there is still enough for the customer and also the shareholder coming from the investment returns.",0
"These include growing fee revenue, streamlining processes to reduce expenses, improving our customer experience and investing for the future in order to deliver strong results through business cycles.",1
"And this, combined and aligned with a very friendly underwriting cycle, plus the almost deflationary trends you see in Europe and also in the U. S., which allows us to benefit from very low claims inflation.",1
"And then also invested in more alternative debt where you get much higher yield, ‚Ç¨3.3 billion, and on the corporate side, mainly switching from bank debt to non-financial, we were still I think overall as a market high weight in that respect, especially reduced the Tier 1 and Tier 2 as we did also in the year 2012.",0
I'd like to draw your attention to the restructuring charges that went up by ‚Ç¨300 million to ‚Ç¨450 million of business.,-1
"Since the initial joint venture with our private equity partner in 2009, we recognized over $5 billion in pre-tax gains.",1
"We have to further work on profitability, but that is underway and recent outflows are more or less in line with the industry.",1
"Fourth quarter credit results followed the positive trend that we have seen all year as charge-offs remain at pre-crisis levels, impacted by our strategic decision to focus on reducing volatility in charge-offs.",1
"‚Ç¨1.155 billion is a very high number for the operating profit, which can immediately creates a question, how sustainable is it, ‚Äì is investment margin driven by additional harvesting.",0
"Our loss provision was $23 million in the quarter, down $44 million sequentially, reflecting continued low levels of net charge-offs and the improving credit profile of our loan portfolio.",-1
"Shareholders' equity, no surprise, slightly lower than after the nine months, falling unrealized gains on bonds, but ‚Ç¨1 billion more in unrealized gains on equity investments.",1
"Run-off, 4.5 percentage point for the full year, yes, above our long-term level of 3.7% or even when you adjust for Fireman's Fund 3.9% level.",1
"So the important thing to note is that although we have had expenses under a tight leash, we haven't cut back on the expansion of the branch network.",1
"However, I guess, in the interest of consistency because most other banks in India account for in this particular manner, we receive instructions, and we've therefore reclassified these amounts.",0
"We've also used for the full year therefore, if you look at the floating provision movement, we've had an opening balance in floating provisions of INR 1,523 crores.",0
"As German started, which we explained to you in our May Capital Markets Day in detail and where we said we are on track, is this endangered?",0
"Where we have a substantial drop is in the performance fee, but I think we were very consistent and always very transparent in our communication that the high performance fee in Q3 2012 was based on settling one-offs this private equity funds, which were started post sub-prime crisis and focused on sub-prime mortgage investments.",-1
"And as a consequence and I'm only talking now about for instance the fourth quarter 2017 results, the ‚Ç¨235 million which was booked under financial instruments fair value is shifting ‚Ç¨108 million into the net interest income.",0
"That is not fully reflecting what is happening, and Belgium is lower, but it's 50% higher, the market growth in Belgium, in Czech Republic and all the Central European countries, they're growing 10% or more.",1
"And this is excluding the reinstatement premium which comes on top at ‚Ç¨45 million, so you can say, weather-related events ‚Ç¨600 million in the quarter.",0
"Now, if we take into account the period since 2012 and we take it forward also the next couple years, then we are having amongst ‚Äì more or less, in total for that period of let's say 10 years about 2.7 million shares, which is roughly 270,000 shares issued per year.",0
"We will have a negative impact of the first-time implication application of IFRS 9, which I highlighted at 41 basis points, and we will have the positive impact of the Tax Reform in Belgium going forward.",-1
"Also we called the CoCo in January 2018, which will have a positive contribution of ‚Ç¨54 million and the Basel 4 impact I just described.",1
"If you look at year-on-year, the ‚Äì there's a stronger decrease and there, we still have ‚Äì we're still suffering from the lower reinvestment yields.",-1
"Investor Relations and our CFO have organized, as usual, a sell-side analyst meeting in London tomorrow morning at our offices in the city of London, Old Broad Street 111.",0
"If you would look at a total year basis, and I will come back to that later on, we will end up with a total net result of almost ‚Ç¨1.8 billion and underlying of ‚Ç¨1.6 billion, which brings us to an ROE of 13%, which is I think at this difficult market circumstance a quite excellent result.",1
"Additionally, we closed on $5.3 billion of stable value wrap business in the quarter, bringing total stable value wrap assets under management to approximately $19 billion at the end of the quarter.",-1
"Institutional operating income increased 19% versus the year-ago period and similarly benefited from crediting rate actions, higher fee income on separate accounts, and higher net investment income.",1
"And last but not least, we have seen over the full year, if you exclude Ireland and ‚Äì the AQR on Ireland and Hungary, we have seen lower impairments on our loan books.",-1
"Our guaranteed income options, effective marketing programs and materials and award-winning customer service continue to differentiate our offerings in the marketplace.",1
"Because of the one-off I earlier mentioned, we are going to review our guidance given only one quarter ago, and it's now updated to the range of ‚Ç¨160 million to ‚Ç¨200 million for the full year.",0
"In terms of other net income, it stands at ‚Ç¨64 million which is substantially higher than previous quarter, and substantially lower than the quarter of last year.",0
"Amongst others, the one-off provisions in Hungary, but also the impact of the ALM derivatives which definitely negatively influences this ratio.",-1
"This morning, I will review the highlights for the quarter‚Äôs results, our capital management activity and our liquidity and capital position.",0
"Also excluding the adjustments, Fixed Annuity earnings increased 25%, benefiting from a reduction in our cost of funds and higher alternative investment income.",1
"It's the  bank insurance (03:39) activity which clearly delivers and in most of our markets, our activities, we performed very well.",0
"The capital ratio, and I would suggest, only talk about the fully loaded Basel 3 ratio now stands at 15.7% which, is substantially higher than our pro forma regulatory minimum imposed upon us by the ECB at 10.40%, if you include the guidance of 100 basis points.",0
"Based on the outlook for our businesses and the current environment, we believe that we can achieve 50 basis points or higher of annual improvement in ROE ex AOCI and DTA through 2017 from a normalized baseline of 7.4% for 2014.",1
"Our intense focus on enhancing customer service in these lines, for example, engineering and loss control services, is increasingly becoming a differentiator for AIG.",1
Now this number both take into account obviously the accelerated repayments and the abolishment of the home country government carve-out which stand ‚Äì I already mentioned ‚Ç¨4.4 billion.,0
"Since quarter-end and through May 2, we repurchased an additional $870 million of common shares which leaves about $3.7 billion unused under the $5 billion authorization that we announced in February.",0
"Operator, before you open the line, I just want to remind everybody that similar to the past quarters, we'll take one question and one follow-up.",1
"But also because we have been able to keep our margins at a very sound level, we were able to push up our margin with 1 basis point.",1
This is actually a good result and is perfectly in line with our expectations and definitely substantially higher than our targets imposed upon us by the ECB and National Bank standing at 10.25% or 11.25% depends if you look into it from a phased or a full approach.,1
I'm pleased that we maintained our strong position in our Life and Retirement segments and delivered another strong quarter in Personal Insurance.,1
The remainder of my comments will exclude the benefit to provide an apples-to-apples comparison of our performance to the strategic targets we set in January.,1
"Despite a challenging economic and regulatory environment, I'm pleased to report that each of our consumer insurance businesses performed well during the quarter reflecting the benefits of our diversified portfolio of Retirement, Life and Personal Insurance businesses.",1
"Year-on-year, we also see a strong reduction of 5%, obviously 2% of that is due to ‚Äì two percentage point is due to foreign exchange impact.",1
"This is ‚Äì this good result is on the back of lower funding costs amongst other term deposits, which have been going down with ‚Ç¨1.6 billion, but it's also influenced by the additional rate cuts, which we did at the beginning of the quarter on saving accounts amongst others in Belgium and in Czech Republic.",-1
"Now, you could say, this is substantially up compared to previous quarter, but let's be fair, previous quarter ‚Ç¨4 million quite ridiculously low and the ‚Ç¨50 million on top is influenced by a model change on the IBNR side for ‚Ç¨25 million.",1
"Yes, indeed, here and there you have a one-off, but if you would exclude one-offs, be in Visa, the  DTAs (27:23) and then also the banking taxes, which we have to pay, then you would see that it would end more than ‚Ç¨620 million which is a superb result.",0
"Last but not the least, because of lagging, a lag effect in the Czech Republic regarding European Single Resolution Fund, we also booked another ‚Ç¨15 million as a contribution to that same fund on top of what we already booked in the first three quarters of 2015.",-1
We are in constant communication with our distribution partners through this complex transition to ensure that we can continue to meet their evolving needs.,0

"Also, Commercial mortgage loan and unexpected accretion income impacted these net investment spreads benefiting variable and index annuities in the current quarter and Fixed Annuities in the prior period.",-1
"This growth in deposits resulted in similar increases in our short-term investment portfolio, which increased $2.8 billion in the quarter.",1
"Compared to the prior quarter, deposits were down primarily due to expected reduction in the commercial mortgage servicing escrow balances from elevated levels in the fourth quarter related to our mortgage servicing acquisition.",-1
"For the full year of 2014, we expect net interest income to be relatively stable with the reported levels in 201 with potential for downward pressure due to the competitive environment.",-1
Expenses were down $19 million or 3% from the prior year and $50 million or 7% from the fourth quarter.,1

"And as you can see on the slide, this has been driven by growth in investments for the account of policyholders and off-balance sheet investments for third parties.",1
"However, there was a negative impact from the movement in our own credit spread in addition to model refinements in the Netherlands.",-1
"Impairments amounted to ‚Ç¨543 million, ‚Ç¨40 million above the previous year, despite the impairment charge for BTG being in the comparative.",-1
"Looking at the full internal model view, the ratio decreased modestly to 194%, mainly due to the implementation of the new EIOPA portfolio for the calculation of the volatility adjuster and negative economic variances.",-1
"This was achieved despite our decision to actively cap or cease sales of some products, given the interest rate environment, with a particularly notable effect in the second half.",1
"Primary Motor decreased by 5.2%, still affected by the decline in average premium, but also due to the cancellation of some large fleet contracts.",-1
"Germany recorded an excellent 90% combined ratio, down 2.5 percentage points, driven by an improving current year loss ratio as well as by a falling cost base, showing the benefits of the ambitious restructuring program being implemented.",1
"Net charge-offs are expected to remain below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points, and our loan loss provision should slightly exceed our level of net charge-offs to provide for loan growth.",1
"Furthermore, we've also been able to maintain a stable holding excess capital position, while returning ‚Ç¨930 million to shareholders for 2016, including a final 2016 dividend of ‚Ç¨0.13 per share.",1

The gross NPEs for the first time for many years is decreasing too by 1.6% from 13.5 to 13.3 million.,0

"Our strategy in this market has been to improve our historically underweight position by strengthening our presence, and that was deliberate, in the fast growing bancassurance channel, as we knew that the agency channel was challenged and the statistics we see every month confirm that.",1
"The long term consistent approach that Jackson has taken to the annuity industry in the U. S. means that it is now generating sustainable and significant cash remittances for shareholders, which is our ultimate yardstick across the Group and across the BUs.",0
"So, by way of concluding remarks, I would like to reiterate; one, that the strength of our overall performance in 2013 ‚Äì to highlight the strength of our overall performance, which demonstrates the quality of the new business franchise and the resilience of our in-force book and also our ability to continue to deliver to grow ‚Äì to deliver growth both in earnings and cash; and two, the improvement in our capital buffers, reflecting both the strong operational performance and the investment market tailwinds.",1
"As a result of the self-help actions carried out at the end of 2016, the Non Core bottom line loss has been reduced to about ‚Ç¨200 million.",1

"Profit in our fee-based business measured by underlying performance increased nearly fivefold between 2010 and 2015, offsetting the decline in spread/risk margin and consequently now accounts for 84% of our total profits on this measure.",-1
"Suffice to say that for now, we still manage capital based from the generation of cash within both Standard Life Investments and Standard Life Insurance Limited.",0
"On page eight, the group capital position continues to be strong, including the upcoming gains from the disposal of DAB in Germany, our common equity Tier 1 ratio transition now stands at 10.8% and is at 10.4% fully-loaded.",1
"Income from our spread/risk business remained steady at ¬£92 million, and its reflection of our move towards a capital-light business doesn't have balance sheet that the PRA have re-categorized Standard Life from a major life group to a retail life group.",0
"So whilst demand for GARS was weak in 2016,  which just keeps (09:54) at $4.3 billion net outflows, largely from the more active wholesale channel, demand for other products continued to grow.",-1
"In life insurance, core earnings remained in line with our expectations at around ¬£600 million per annum, with a 7% increase in the transfer from with profits, offsetting lower in-force annuity profits following longevity reinsurance transactions in 2016 and 2017.",1
"We remain disciplined in our approach to reinvestment in our business to secure additional growth, driving higher cash generation and delivery of our progressive dividend policy.",1
"Despite the ongoing transition from guaranteed to non-guaranteed business, we achieved a strong 11.5% top-line growth adjusted for currency changes and discontinued businesses, that is corporate banking and public sector.",1
"We don't need to create capital, as you see from the amount of capital, 10 points for capital we created just the first half year alone.",0
"With an increase of 18% in IFRS earnings from the Asia in-force book and a 24% increase in insurance income, the growth on these key measures remains strong.",1
"As M&G's cost base is typically higher in the second half of the year, we expect the cost/income ratio of 53% at the half year stage to move towards 60% at the full year as we have previously guided.",0
"If you look at key figures on page 12, you see how the result of NOK923 million is composed by net profit sharing and loan losses by mainly discontinued business and one-off items, which is a fairly large item of NOK477 million this quarter, and the result before profit sharing and loan losses which is the highest quality component of the earning.",0
"As you can see, the reported Group net profit came in at ‚Ç¨916 million, more than double the results of the first quarter.",0
"As we choose the growth we want, we choose the markets it's in, and we choose the value of those earnings over the volume.",1
"So, the footprint we have, the capabilities we have, the services we have seemed to be fitting the major demographic trends.",0
"But I think where really we have done a big improvement, in my opinion, is on the risk management area.",1
We continue to successfully execute our capital management strategy and bought back 1.45 million shares for about $113 million during the quarter.,1
"As you see, it's 9% increase with an increase that is growing is accelerating in the fourth quarter and it is continuing also in January.",1
"If we normalize or if we consider currency movements as well as discontinued business, the underlying development is 1.8%, up from last year, which means that we managed to replace the revenues that we lose from the guaranteed back book with a stronger growth in the front book as Odd Arild just talked about.",0
We would estimate that effect to be about something in excess of 1% of our premium growth rate ‚Äì premium base growth rate that is.,1
"Retail bank has a strong growth of 28% within retail lending, and by this we are the fastest growing bank in the Norwegian market.",1
"Asset-Intensive subsegment continues to perform above its quarterly expected run rate of $30 million to $35 million in pre-tax operating income, in this case producing $40 million this quarter.",0
We believe this to be an isolated situation with a unique environment in Australia involving a product we reinsure nowhere else in the world to any material extent.,0
"The very strong premium growth in Asia reflected some client reporting catch ups, while normalized organic growth for the quarter is more in a range of 20% to 25%.",1
"The key difference from  year end being (8:40) related to the higher phase-in of revaluation reserves of pension funds, they amount to 11 basis point and of the minority interest deduction for 10 basis point.",0
So our overall housing loans portfolio continue to be ‚Äì to remain resilient and be very high collateral coverage ratio.,0
Operating expenses increased by 11% to CHF 353 million due to business growth and higher real estate assets in both PAM and TPAM.,-1
"Then it's very difficult from the logistics standpoint, from the management standpoint, you take too much time, one bank enable to provide.",-1
"Looking forward, we remain confident in our proven approach and on our ability to continue to deliver attractive financial results.",1
Longevity experience was very favorable with the quarter also benefiting from underlying business growth and favorable foreign currency translation of $3.1 million.,1
"Global market and investment management, however, recorded a lower operating profit, mainly due to the tougher operating conditions in the interest rate and fixed income space.",0
The fact that we achieved this growth without losing sight of our ongoing focus on profitability stands out especially in the improved value of new business.,1
"Furthermore, some 40% of the total cost savings of CHF 130 million to CHF 160 million announced under Swiss Life 2015 has already been implemented.",1
The group solvency ratio registered a corresponding decrease falling from 239% at the end of 2012 to 205% at the end of June 2013.,-1
"Going forward, we expect a run rate of pre-tax operating income to be a loss of around $10 million to $12 million per quarter, although it can be somewhat uneven.",-1
"As we indicated at our Investor Day in May, we feel that we are well-positioned in Asia with leadership positions in virtually all our markets.",1
"Non-interest income was up 9% year-on-year, as fee income powered ahead with strong momentum in wealth management fees and fund management fees.",1
"Gross loans grew 7% year-on-year, while deposits increased 5%, as we take advantage of the more attractive rates for market funding.",1
"Against the same quarter, net interest income increased 12% to SGD 1.4 billion, driven by, again, improvement in margins to 1.75%.",1
"So, some of excess funds we're placing with the domestic bank that's offshore to take advantage of some of the attractive use that they're giving us.",1
"Denis sends his regards today as he's unable to join us due to the SCOR Board and AGM obligation, so let's begin.",0
"Normalized net combined ratio stands at 93.7%, below the assumption made for Vision in Action as a result of the underlying performance of the P&C book.",-1
"And I think like previous years, most of these are to banks, and we explained that these are to top tier, so that we are not caught by this fallout ‚Äì worry of the fall of the shadow banking in our mind will affect the lower of the banks.",0
"Overseas branches performed exceptionally well with a steady growth of 16.8% year-on-year, in particular U. S. and UK, mainly from strong net interest income and fees growth.",1
"Adjusting for a small currency effect, this leads to an adjusted profit from operations of CHF1.014 billion for the prior year.",0
"The core earning is up 7%, cash earnings up 17% with core earnings 5% up in the second half of the year.",1
"So the result of all of those strategies that I've talked to has led to a stronger balance sheet, but it did have a drag on margins.",-1
"The P&C combined ratio for the full-year stands at 93.9% in line with the indications for 2013 given in the Optimal Dynamics plan, and the Life technical margin reaches 7.3%, also trending towards the Optimal Dynamics assumptions.",0
Our fee and commission income was up by 5% to ‚Ç¨272 million given the positive contribution from our owned IFAs.,1
Our approach is to deliver productivity that offsets ongoing cost growth so that overall cost increases largely relate to investments that are driving future step changes in productivity.,1
Our new business pipeline continues to be healthy across all product lines with new business margins expected to meet or exceed the group profitability target.,1
"Indeed, it is a policy of the group to anticipate these risks and to absorb them within the framework of the group's risk appetite.",0
It's built on the continuous maximization of diversification which in turn is the basis for optimizing the group's capital efficiency and profitability.,1
Moving on to page 13 of the presentation SCOR Global Life delivered a healthy growth and a strong technical performance in the first quarter of 2015.,1
"Moving on to page 10 of the presentation, I'm pleased to report that in the first nine months of 2016, SCOR Global Life continues to combine growth and strong profitability.",1
"Overall, technical performance over the first nine months of 2016 remains robust, with the technical margin standing at 7.1%, slightly above the range assumed in Vision in Action.",0
"In credit cards, as you can see, almost a 1% pickup in market share, and that's on the back of focus, on the back of product simplification and some new products.",0
The group has been successful in meeting those targets over the first two years of Optimal Dynamics and confirms its ability to continue delivering both of them.,1
"Moving slide on to slide 13, the Value of New Business is almost identical to 2011 even though there weren't any longevity or other large transactions in 2012.",0
"Now many of you'll remember going back to 2009 when we invested quite significantly into Westpac Retail and Business Bank through our Westpac local series of initiatives and its' really pleasing to see that since second half of 2010, we've grown our core earnings in this business every year or every half.",1
"Asset quality trends this half were probably a bit better than even we expected, and it'd be hard to see our impairment charge going lower in the second half of the year.",1
"Thanks to this tool and thanks to the detailed information available in the cat platform, underwriters have a unique view of risks worldwide and they can provide excellent support to global clients.",1
"As Denis said, I would like to also report that we successfully launched SCOR Life & Health Ventures that is accelerating our innovation strategy.",1
"The majority of this performance can be attributed to net investment income, as well as realized gains on equity sales.",1
WIB continues to operate in a very competitive environment with spread pressure on both sides of the balance sheet as well as low returns on capital.,0
"I think also importantly as the chart highlights, it hasn't been ‚Äì it's been a very consistent performance over a number of periods.",0
The group delivered a solid set of results in the first half of 2018 with the group net income of $1 billion.,1
"But in this case, it's not the capital increases of the bank and that we do just for the sake of it.",1
"So once again, we have signed the agreement, so 725 different agencies with 470 staff; premium portfolio is around ‚Ç¨1 billion.",0
"So once again, all of these highlights are detailed in the pages that you can see now in the slides, so let me go through this slide quickly.",0
"As for the CET1, so I'm now talking about Basel III, so this is 8.5%; Banca Sai is 23.1% in terms of CET1.",0
"We want to have sustainable long-term combined ratios, so something which is not really too much linked to specific contingent situations.",0
I don't think we will see a very margin positive effect on the balance sheet and the P&L in the previous ‚Äì for the years to come.,-1
One remark we already have is very positive with the contribution of our two big companies in Ukraine and in Russia.,1
"If we switch on to page number three, you see figures which, according to our opinion, underline that we had some significant and even say, solid operating profit based on a robust growth throughout all our regions, especially our two core regions Austria plus the CEE.",1
"We published a so-called one SFCR report, meaning we cover with that this UNIQA Group, the UNIQA Insurance Group and the Austrian entity.",0
"So, we're missing here ‚Ç¨40 million on realized gains out of the real estate and we did a normal development over the first half year.",1
New business margins and all the economic figures for 2014 we will announce and have the conference call in April.,0
Even it's clear that reinvestments are challenging and our reinvestment is on a fixed income portfolio around about in the area of 1.5% to 2%.,-1
"On the one side, we've seen negative development in our Italian branch office of Donau and in Romania, and this brings down the profit before taxes by roughly 29% to ‚Ç¨316 million.",-1
"In Poland, we saw a significant decrease in the life premiums of more than 24% out of the development of single premium business.",-1
"That is what we believe is a proper way of offsetting the fact that we give a lot of freedom that must be connected with a lot of responsibility as well independent of any sort of personal guilt or any sort of personal wrongdoing, which is not the case in this particular situation.",0
So one thing I'm pretty sure I can guarantee you is that I will not be able to answer all the questions and luckily I have Vibhu Sharma with me.,1
"However, we have taken a number of important steps in our GI business and in evaluating our options in Global Life.",0
Z-ECM ratio is at 134% with strong operating capital generation of 6 percentage points complemented by a similar benefit from market movements and this is more than offsetting  the call (04:09) of the dividend.,1
"Third, and for Z-ECM only, these factors were partially offset by a change in how we model certain investment risks.",0
Net charge-offs increased $107 million from Q4 2016 as we continued to experience modest and expected seasoning of our credit card portfolio and loan growth.,-1
"Global Private Banking revenue fell by 6% as we continue to de-risk the business, but the revenue increased in Asia due to higher client activity in the first half.",1
"Whilst this factored in foreseeable capital requirements, it did not anticipate and could not have anticipated the full extent of capital commitments and additional costs  after this (21:50) in the years to come.",0
"Recall that our performance in the first quarter of 2015 included the positive impact of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and the strong renminbi market, which benefited us more than most.",1
"Adjusted profit before tax was $357 million in ASEAN, which was up 14% due to lower LICs and lower costs.",1
Overdraft fees in the UK fell again due to re-pricing and the creation of a text message service to alert our customers when they go overdrawn.,0
"This was driven mainly by balance sheet management, partly due to increased gains on the disposal of our available-for-sale securities.",1
"Looking at each of the priorities we set out in March of last year, we have cause for confidence in achieving our objectives.",1
Our 30- and 90-day delinquency trends for the UK card portfolio have been pretty stable in recent quarters and for Q1 was 2% and 0.9% respectively.,1
We didn't complete any material disposals in the businesses category but I would remind you that we have sales of the Egyptian and French banks progressing towards completion expected to be in Q2 or perhaps early Q3 in the case of France.,1
"This year, we bought shares in the market to satisfy most of these awards rather than issuing new shares as we have in previous years.",1
"Income was down 2%, largely reflecting the shift in portfolio mix in U. S. cards to increase the prime proportion, including growing our own brand prime card, and the Q1 asset sale.",-1
"I've shown on this slide the 5% reduction in our cost base, excluding litigation and conduct, from 2016 to 2017.",1
The other effect is that the U. S. DTA write-down takes our timing difference DTAs well below the threshold at which we would incur a capital deduction.,0
This implies a loss for the second half in the range of ¬£300 million to ¬£400 million from the operations absorbed into the core businesses.,-1
"As Jes mentioned, we are pleased with the progress we have made this quarter in Non-Core, following our onetime top-up announced on the 1st of March.",1
"Plus, the transactional banking fell by 1% to ¬£408 million, although balances continue to grow and we expect income to pick up again in Q2.",1
"Income always tends to move faster than costs, but a very significant reduction in impairment means the non-core loss before tax was down 24%, with attributable loss down 43%.",1
"And we are confident that it will continue to be well capitalized with a balanced funding profit, supporting solid investment grade credit ratings.",1
The elimination of Non-Core continued apace in the second quarter with a further reduction of ¬£4 billion in risk-weighted assets.,0
"It will additionally mean annualized costs reducing by about ¬£250 million and a head count roll-off of about 1,500 employees as colleagues transfer across this part of the sales.",0
The diversification of our business coupled with a conservative risk profile makes us extremely resilient and we won't lose that strength.,-1

"And finally and very importantly through our innovation division, which includes our InnoVentures funds, working with other partners and looking at new sources of revenues and other ways to improve our business, I mean, our core business in the future.",1

You have the figures there in which we focus the most to see if our strategy is going in the right direction.,0
Just let me ‚Äì remember that the comfort zone where we would like to be is between 110% and 115%.,0
"This unit that used to be ‚Äì have a significant line from the parent company now is self-funded, 50%-plus core deposits, the other 50% will be on insurance and the securitizations.",0

The quick implementation of efficiency measures in the main units of the group enabled us to achieve in the first nine months the figure for the whole 2014.,1

"For the rest of the year we expect around summer to incorporate Belgium and Portugal, around the fall Spain, Switzerland and Holland and at the beginning of 2016 Germany, Austria, and Italy.",0
Let me remind you to ask no more than two questions per participant so everyone that has joined the call can ask the management.,0
"And because there is more competition in some products since last summer, there is a mix effect on the competition of our portfolio which is changing towards lower-risk products, more secure products, and lower growth in volumes, which we believe is temporary; whilst the other two effects we think are more structural in nature.",1
"In other words, Spain and Poland undergoing merger processes, their recurring costs will fall, of course, excluding the restructuring costs, higher synergies, as the mergers proceed.",-1
The main task here now is the integration that is on track ‚Äì the integration between Kredyt Bank and our franchise.,0
"And our tangible net asset value has been affected this quarter by the FX, but we are on track to meet our goal.",0
"Accommodating this into the numbers, we have this quarter pretty consistent numbers quarter-after-quarter, we are in the region between ‚Ç¨1.6 billion, ‚Ç¨1.7 billion a quarter.",0
"And when it comes ‚Äì you see the activity at the bottom, you see that mutual fund balance are growing 9%, the turnover in credit cards ‚Äì in debit cards is growing at 17%, insurance premiums is growing at 11%.",0
"You cannot reduce deposit costs while you have a reduction ‚Äì continued reduction on the loan book and we've been able to match in this environment, yeah.",-1

"Global Markets were resilient, revenues down by minus  4.9% (00:13:23) compared with Q4 last year, significant improvement as compared with Q3 despite unfavorable market environment.",-1
"We have a net underlying profit of ‚Ç¨1.392 million, which is up 50% compared with last year and an underlying profitability of 10.5% this quarter.",1
"And, for example, you have a twofold increase in Europe, a resilient contribution from KB, KB still posting a return on equity in the range of 23%.",1
"Very briefly, slide 28, just to show that 2016 is a year ‚Äì is an additional year of progress, I would say in value creation for our shareholders.",1
So much for the group so now I can move to the businesses and I will start this review with the French Retail Banking.,0
"And I can make the risk so financial services to corporates, insurance, our bank in Czech Republic, consumer financing in Germany and France and in this respect if you have a look on this slide on page 16 it is striking to note the resilience of revenues over the past five quarters run ‚Ç¨1.9 billion.",0
"Philippe has mentioned our new private banking business in France or the integration of Newedge as an example, the financing development also in GBIS.",0
"We have also good development of protection and non-line insurance activity with premiums up by 10% in France and 12% aboard, and we saw solid activity in Financial Services of Corporates.",1
"In this context, IBFS has continued to, let's say, the very clear trends we have seen in the beginning of this year with the strong commercial activity, with outstanding loans rising by 5.6% and outstanding loans by 2.9%.",1
"And if we could stop, I would say, at 2:15, I think it would be good for all of us.",1
"So globally, this is a reflection of restructuring of our liabilities as deposit has increased, we have, at the same time, reduced our short-term funding by ‚Ç¨15 million, and overall our short-term funding is covered over 136% by our liquidity buffer.",-1
"And as mentioned by Fr√©d√©ric, the Group net income stood on an underlying basis at ‚Ç¨1.1 billion so up 40%.",1
"Maybe one word here in terms of methodology, we had decided this quarter to repatriate the French consumer finance business within the French Retail Banking.",0
"Operating expenses increased by 2.1%, but if we exclude regulatory tax increase like the first contribution to the local resolution fund in Czech Republic for ‚Ç¨21 million, overheads are flat for IBFS.",-1
"The additional costs were partly related to litigation matters connected to a commercial dispute in our Wholesale business, as well as highly ‚Äì higher variable expenses in our Wealth management business reflecting stronger than expected revenue growth.",-1
"Adjusted expenses were up versus last year due to Target expenses and investments and growth initiatives, partially offset by productivity improvements; all-in, a strong result for our U. S. business.",-1
"We expect the fourth quarter to be down from Q3, primarily due to a lower level of security gains, as mentioned previously.",-1
"We are looking even harder at our expense base to ensure we can drive efficiencies for next year, including continued consolidation of our facilities in Canada and the U. S. and other initiatives.",1
"Our results in the second quarter were solid with adjusted EPS of C$1.90, up 4% year-over-year and total bank adjusted net income of C$1.8 billion, up 6% from last year.",1
"We remain committed to eliminating adjusted expense growth, excluding acquisitions and FX, to 3% for the fiscal year 2013 as a whole.",1
"We are pleased to announce a dividend increase of $0.04 or 9% from the current level, on the heels of last year's 12% growth.",1
"Revenue decreased by 1% year-over-year, as strong volume and deposit growth was offset by lower gains on sale of securities, lower Target revenues and lower margins, partially driven by competition.",1
"Additionally, our industry is changing in fundamental ways and at breakneck speed, as new technologies lower the barriers to entry and innovative competitors emerge.",-1
"To conclude, the key takeaways this quarter are credit quality remains strong across the Bank's portfolios, and we remain well-positioned for continued quality loan growth.",1
Credit performance continues to be favorable with PCL and personal banking up by $8 million from last year due to the addition of Aeroplan balances.,1

"The UK statutory rate will fall again in 2014 and taking into account all the other factors impacting on the rate, I will suggest that you use 21.5% as the effective rate for 2014 and reducing to 21% for 2015 and beyond.",1
We do expect to continue to incur some cost-related to those major legal actions in the first half of 2014.,0
"The charge in the second half will be a fraction lower than that, as we will retire ¬£8.5 million of notes when they mature in August this year.",0
"The interest accrual is slightly higher, as that reflects the buildup of interest during the first half which is paid in the second half.",0
"Global broking continue to face changing markets, although positive performances in Asia and the U. S. part cushioned a weaker result in Europe.",-1
"When used on this call, adjusted net trading income refers to our trading income, net of all interest and dividend income and expenses and all brokerage and clearing expenses.",0
"And then, we also have good foreign stock trading and increase interest in foreign markets and Avanza Markets contributed to higher other income and corporate finance were a bit slower quarter one, but we had a very strong Q4 and that is of course volatile business in itself.",1
"The securities transactions are still executing smaller volumes and in lower commission classes, which produced slightly lower brokerage income for turnover, which fell from 10.3 basis points to 10 basis points drop from Q4.",-1
Margin lending is down 5% during the quarter to SEK 3.6 billion and is now amounting to 1% ‚Äì 1.8% of total savings capital.,-1
I am pleased to say that we are well ahead of the schedule and have made voluntary repayments totaling $200 million towards our term loan within the first three months post-closing.,1
"So on the same basis as the original estimate, we would arrive at $262 million in total synergies realized in 2018.",0
"This excess capital will allow us several options, reduce debt further, maintain our dividend; and depending on the circumstances, even consider share repurchases at the appropriate time.",0
"On a non-GAAP basis, our normalized net income, excluding mainly the impact of stock-based compensation and vesting of stock-based awards granted at the IPO, as well as other one-time items was $291.2 million for the full-year and $57.1 million for the fourth quarter.",0
"Assuming a normal tax rate of 35.5% and $138.9 million fully converted shares outstanding, this translates to $0.27 per share in normalized EPS for the fourth quarter.",1
"The repo rate was on an average 36 basis points, lower during Q1 2016 compared to the same period last year.",0
"Furthermore, I think we have the customers, the knowledge, and we have unique cost position that is very hard to copy.",1
"When comparing brokerage income year-on-year, you should also bear in mind that trades in ETPs are from 2016 to the largest extent done in above the market, meaning these revenues are shown as other income instead of brokerage income.",0
"The increases in revenue during the quarter came from both meaningful growth and legacy Virtu and KCG's trading P&L, driven by revenue synergies across the firm.",1
These year-over-year improvements reflect a more favorable overall volume and volatility environment in the first half of this year versus last year.,1
"While we do not discuss specific market share and market capture statistics, in the second quarter we also saw improvements in our execution quality in various global markets and, in particular, in our European equities business where we are seeing more demand for our fully electronic market making services for ETP products throughout Europe.",1
"In the midst of the politically morass in Washington our customers have remained engaged and active in October with DARTs averaging 158,000 month-to-date, a 7% increase over September.",1

"Building on this momentum and on behalf of the Board and my colleagues, I am incredibly proud to announce the most significant developments the company has seen in years with respect to capital efficiency and company structure.",1
"As for Q1, once E*TRADE Securities is moved we plan to dividend excess capital to the parent, which we estimate to be around $430 million.",1
"Well, we don't have a specific ratio there, but I think when you factor in our goal of getting down to a billion dollars of debt, inherently there's going to be some double leverage, which means the parent ratio would be something less than 9%.",0
"In addition, the introducing broker generated 30 million of capital during the quarter, and we intend to move that amount to the parent in the coming weeks.",0
"With your reenergized and more productive E*TRADE now reality, Navtej and I agree that now is the right time to flatten our leadership structure.",1
"As a reminder, we will not request a dividend from the bank to the parent in Q4 as the bank reported a Q3 net loss of $186 million.",-1
"These costs are certainly not insignificant and as we noted on numerous occasions, moving over to $50 billion line won't benefit our owners, particularly in the current rate environment.",-1
"We consolidated our business segment and realigned both our income statement and yield table, all of which are reflective of how we currently manage the business.",0
"On a pre-tax basis, these items were $6 million of severance related to our prior CEO, the $25 million of restructuring and acquisition related expenses I just mentioned and a $62 million provision benefit.",0
It also includes a net benefit of $0.33 per share related to provision and income tax benefits partially offset by executive severance and certain restructuring costs.,-1
Derivatives represented a steady 29% of total DARTs which is consistent with our expectations ahead of the launch of our fully-integrated platform.,0
"This was driven by high order flow revenue related to a higher mixing of options trades, and higher asset based fees, larger mutual based balances, as well as the increase rate on all off-balance sheet deposits.",1
"One housekeeping note, we are now providing the detailed breakout, breakdown of this line item in the press release in addition to the 10-Q, where it has been included for some time.",0

"We generated over ‚Ç¨311 million of revenues in six month, all recurring, up 10.3% year-on-year, with all product areas positively contributing.",1
"We are very satisfied of these results, which are also very resilient in comparison with the previous quarter overcoming the usual seasonality factors.",-1

"At that time, the annual combined operating cost of both companies were $400 million, with just under half of those costs being relevant to our synergy plan.",0
"A quarterly dividend of $0.06 will be paid on December 21, and share buybacks continue to be a strong focus, particularly as we feel our shares remain undervalued.",1
"The company may at some point elect to update the forward-looking statements made today, but specifically disclaims any obligation to do so.",0
2017 will be marked as a year of multi-decade low market volatility which clearly had an adverse impact on GAIN's performance for both the fourth quarter and full year.,-1
"And more importantly, we want it to be something we can replicate by whether it needs buying other businesses to add to our existing, whether it means building other businesses through geography or through product or through customer segment or whether it means folding in existing situations, whether it be commission-based business or institutional and it doesn't mean de-emphasizing the retail business, it means building a complementary infrastructure around it, so that our ability to generate these kinds of returns like we did in Q2 can become more like the norm than a stand out.",0
Finally GAIN will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share on March 29 for holders of record as of March 25.,0
"Those familiar with such environments will appreciate how they can  translate (4:05) into low volumes and revenue capture, something that has affected the market making industry in general during Q3.",0
"So ultimately, the cost reduction efforts, the scaling efforts, and the ‚Äì if you want organizational scaling efforts are paying off for us and we're excited about coming periods.",1
"Our retail OTC business delivered strong performance for the quarter on the backdrop of improving market conditions, which drove client engagement.",1
"On the far right we estimate the performance of the two combined companies for the year, assuming we achieve 75% of the midpoint of our $35 million to $45 million expense synergy estimate.",1

"We achieved approximately $100 million in adjusted EBITDA for the full year, driven by a strong fourth quarter performance with quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $36.9 million.",1

"Options contract volume was down 15%, while futures contract volume and stock share volume were up 33% and 18%, respectively.",-1
"Because our customer stays very actively, they understand the importance of minimizing the all-in trading cost, which includes not only explicit costs like commission and exchange fees, but also the implicit costs like price improvement or disimprovement, market impact, and exchange and DART pool rebates.",0
I'm often asked for an estimate of our share of our addressable customer base we currently have and how much further can we grow.,1
"Brokerage pre-tax profit margin was 52%, down from 64% in the year-ago quarter, and Market Making pre-tax profit margin was 39%, up from 28% in the year-ago quarter.",1

"Bob will now provide further comments on our GAAP results, as well as our non-compensation costs and several other financial matters.",0
These results were up 35% from the prior year and 7% in comparison to the second quarter of this year.,1
The increase in non-compensation expenses was affected by the general growth in our head count and the pickup in our business activity.,-1
This conference call is being webcast live on the Investor Relations' section of the website and an archive of it will be available beginning approximately one hour after the conclusion of this call for 30 days.,0
"As all of you are aware, the first quarter typically is a seasonally lower than other quarters, but this was the best first quarter in our firm's history with revenues up 11% year-over-year on a comparable basis.",1
"Eduard Kostadinov has committed to join us from Morgan Stanley in Germany, focusing on this sector for Europe, as well as expanding large company coverage in that country.",0
Our industrials and consumer retail teams are continuing to build out around the five SMDs added over the last year or so and have already been mandated on several important engagements with prominent companies in their sectors.,0
"Net revenues in Investment Banking were $243 million, up 29% from the second quarter a year ago and up 13% sequentially.",1
"But even without the Equities business, firm-wide revenues would have been up 32% and our Advisory revenues were up even more.",1
"I should add here that Cogent, our acquisition which was consummated on April 1, separately had $10.4 million of unaudited first quarter revenue, which is consistent with its strong revenue pace last year and reinforces our enthusiasm for that business.",1
"Our improved revenue outcome resulted in cost ratios far below last year's first quarter levels, with our compensation ratio at 54%, the same as last year's full year result, and our non-compensation costs in absolute dollars very similar to last year's full year run rate but for some one-time transaction costs related to the Cogent acquisition.",1
"Our earnings per share for the quarter were $0.62 and for the year-to-date were $0.75, reflecting increases of 104% and 36% respectively versus last year.",1
I will cover the financial updates for the quarter and the full year other than advisory revenue which was covered by Scott.,0
"However, given that those unusual items are both non-recurring and explained in our press release and upcoming 10-K filing, I will focus the remainder of my remarks on the more fundamental aspects of our business both with respect to 2017 and the year ahead.",0
"Last year, we had a strong finish and a much improved full year result in Europe, and in the year-to-date several of our significant announced transactions have been in that market.",1
"Even if we finalized our exit from this business, it's worth remembering that notwithstanding some unwelcome losses as we liquidate the last remains of our portfolio, principal investing has still generated net review for the firm of over $260 million since our IPO.",-1
The increased ratio of compensation to revenue was a function of a lower revenue result in the first quarter compared to a year ago.,1
"Similarly, industry data indicates that Australia deal activity is a bit weaker than it has been in the past few years and also was still at roughly half of the peak level.",-1
Our client and transaction diversification remains one of our pillars and we seldom have any single transaction that exceeds 2% of our firm's revenues in a fiscal year.,0
We've experienced a number of trends in our business in the first half of the year that emphasize the strength of our business model and our three product lines.,1
"For the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we had an adjustment of $10 million related to the vesting of grants that were issued in connection with our IPO and we expect this adjustment to continue until our last tranche of pre-IPO grants vest in April 2020.",0
"The value of these shares is treated as income to our employees and we withheld approximately 806,000 shares in order to satisfy our tax withholding obligations.",0
"And in fact, during the quarter we hired three new MDs in our London office, one in our business services sector and two in our illiquid financial asset practice.",0
"On the geographical front, the firm has continued to deploy more resources outside the U. S. over the last several years and our non-U.",0
"As we move into fiscal 2017, we are focused on continuing to integrate both our new acquisitions and new employees into the overall fabric of the firm.",0
"The global disinflationary environment continues to be a powerful catalyst for M&A, as the companies looked for strategic options to grow or to rationalize their business.",1
"First, our Asset Management business has achieved sequential growth in management fees, net inflows and a strong pattern of investment performance in a turbulent market.",1
"Asset Management's fourth quarter revenue increased 6% and despite volatile markets, finished the year with a 6% increase in AUM.",1
"We're achieving organic growth in Asset Management through the incubation, development and scaling up of new strategies across our investment platforms.",1
"So, in a nutshell, I would say that we have had a strong start of the year in an environment that has been quite volatile in terms of markets and, of course, still very much negative in terms of interest rates.",1
"And we have had a slight decrease in a ROAC because of the higher capital absorption, but still a ROAC of 14%.",0
"So the ability to develop client activity both in terms of new lending, where we have had this important increase in CIB in consumer and mortgages, that reverting into plus 8% in stock but also in the ability of the group to develop total financial asset, this year, 4.7%, for a platform that has been newly created, so something that is at the very start of this trajectory.",1
"But also, we are very positive on the potential in some sector consolidation and some important increase of Mediobanca market present in MidCaps on the back of the Private Banking project.",1
"Asset quality improved third in the last quarter and loans were up by 2%, driven by all segment new production.",1
"The two networks, Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire, have a fine synergy working between them and you will note that with our 7% increase in the net revenues in 2014, we have exceeded our forecasts and our ambitions, and I hope we'll continue to do that in the coming years.",-1
"Finally, let's end with P&C with the combined ratio with our view in the kind of intimate indicator for assessing the performance of P&C.",0
"Great illustration of the originated distributing model within the CIB, but also we have increased the share of the Investment Solution business since end of 2013.",1
"And therefore, it seems to us that we have to increase our collective positions in order to be more conservative and careful.",0
"However, we still have the CCI since the disposal of the CCI is going to occur at the end of July and beginning of August.",0
"We also have taken advantage of this situation to issue Tier 2 on the 11th of July, ‚Ç¨1 billion in order to start working for the group and for Natixis on the total capital of the group.",1
"There has been a drop of 4% year-on-year and a drop of 2% between the first half of 2012 and the first half of this year, which overall has enabled us to have an increase of 5% gross increase from one semester to the next and a 57% improvement in the cost/income ratio in the same period.",1
So the cost income ratios increased by three points in this quarter and we have profitability that is also increased.,1
"Moving on to the results themselves, there are a number of exceptional items, the  emission (06:57) spread what we also call the revaluation of own senior debt, which will be ‚Ç¨46 million before tax and ‚Ç¨29 million after tax impact in net income.",0
"Cost of risk is down by 17% relative to last year, which gives us a pre-tax profit of ‚Ç¨479 million; up 12%.",-1
"Compared to the prior year, our broader platform with the addition of the GKST team has led to increased activity on our flow desk commensurate with the resources we have brought on board.",1
"This new presentation of deal expenses also has a collateral effect on some of the ratios used to track our performance, notably, the comp ratio and operating margin.",0
"Our biotech team led the way for us in 2017 as that sector again, was the most active segment in the market for capital raising.",1
We intend to maintain our focus on increasing the return to shareholders over time through the effective management of our capital.,1
"The strong equity markets, up approximately 30% from the end of 2012, produced an active capital raising environment at the end of 2013.",1
We made significant progress to this effect with the addition of the Cupps Capital Management investment team which we announced during the quarter.,1
"Consistent with prior quarters, we presented the expenses with certain non-GAAP adjustments, which are more fully described in our 8-K.",0
"This will enable us to expand this franchise, by capitalizing on the many growth opportunities we see across GP recapitalizations, portfolio sales and securitizations.",1
"But just as we said on our last earnings call, rarely will any one reporting period be truly representative of the earnings power of our franchise or our business momentum.",0
"So I think if you look at our first nine months operating and average it out you can see that that's our operating level and feel very, very comfortable about where we are.",0
"From a goal standpoint, this last year was our second best year ever to 2009 when there was kind of a flight from certain players that were in the papers, certain that weren't, and we were certainly beneficiaries of that.",1
The next and last tranche of those will be two years from this quarter when some of the Capital Markets five-year retention awards vest.,0
"That portfolio had below 4% return for the quarter, so that was a big non-taxable gain for us in the quarter.",1
"We had a plan three years ago, but everyone seems to be going robo, robo, robo, but we believe that electronic delivery to clients has always been in our plans, and we'll talk about how we're addressing that this week.",0
"I believe, they show the earnings power of the firm and kind of the model we have that certainly has been successful.",1
"Net income of $259.3 million, which increased 12% over the first half of fiscal 2016, and also represents a record start to the fiscal year.",1
"The last thing I'd like to do is touch on how we did versus some of the targets that ‚Äì my targets that I mentioned at analyst day, I should qualify that.",0
So our emphasis on training continues to increase since we've put more and more people into our training programs for our next generation advisors.,1
So I'm going to turn it over to Jeff who will give you some line items and some more detail and talk a little bit about the outlook for these segments.,0
"I think, we've put that in our Q but we have it ready in time, we'll just include it in the press release.",0
"Now there's still some factors that we don't totally have our arms around and we still don't have answers on and interpretations of, et cetera.",0
"Regarding the outlook for Global Advisory, we can say that our weighted pipeline remains stronger than at the same time last year with a constant exchange rate.",1
"While the minimarket condition are largely positive, we believe at this stage that repeating 2015-2016 revenue performance might be a challenge given that the second half-year revenue performance was delivered during the last part of the year.",-1
"What that means is that  overall as (24:30) we look at the adjusted comp ratio, it declined by around 1% from 64% in the prior year to 63% in the year to March 2016.",-1
"We prefer to see a steady albeit modest improvement rather than having to worry about significant volatility in earnings per share, given the nature of some of our businesses.",-1
"If you look at combining mutual funds and EPS, active domestic funds experienced outflows of $45.8 billion after experiencing $36.7 billion of outflows in the first quarter.",0
"Moving on to our balance sheet, we finished the quarter at $20.5 billion in assets on our consolidated balance sheet, up roughly $1 billion from the prior quarter's levels, due primarily to growth at Stifel Bank.",1
"After these charges, which primarily represent the last of the Barclays' acquisition cost, we expect any charges in 2018 to be minimal.",0
"For the fourth quarter, we are maintaining our quarterly operating expense guidance of $151 million to $158 million, excluding the provision for loan losses.",0
"The balance of approximately $77 million, based on the minimum number of shares issued, again, will be subject to adjustments at closing.",0
Whereas our institutional business is almost ‚Äì mostly a result of the professionals we've brought onboard to Stifel via mergers.,0
The provision for loan loss expense in the quarter was relatively flat as compared to the first quarter at approximately $6 million.,-1
"As the market for deposits is increasingly competitive, the use of CDs as a funding source could continue as we look to expand our bank and our net interest income.",0
We're on track to complete the acquisition of the U. S. fixed income and the European trading team of Knight Capital Group.,0
"This decline was the result of increased levels of cash on our balance sheet at the beginning of the quarter, due to money market reform that caused us to sweep more cash to Stifel Bank.",-1
"Earlier this afternoon, we just released our press release with our second quarter results and posted a slide deck on our website.",0
Higher earnings in CIBC FirstCaribbean due to favorable foreign exchange and good credit performance was largely offset by lower investment gains.,1
"Revenue was $550 million, up $107 million or 24% from the same quarter last year with solid performance from all business lines including a full quarter results from our recently acquired Atlantic Trust business.",1
"Performance benefited from volume growth, wider spreads on our variable rate lending products and higher insurance and card fee income.",1
"Against this backdrop, this quarter, we did begin to see delinquency increases across various retail products, particularly in credit cards and unsecured lending.",-1
Personal deposits and GIC growth of 8% benefited from the success of our recently launched Smart Account as well as growth from other savings and GIC promotions.,1
"Wealth Management achieved 11% earnings growth, driven by solid asset growth and we delivered strong client-driven performance in Wholesale Banking.",1
"Subsequent to the quarter end, CIBC sold an equity investment that was pervious acquired to a loan restructuring in our exited European leveraged finance business.",-1
"During the quarter, CIBC achieved the second highest average rating among the big six bank-owned brokerages in the Investment Executive Brokerage Report Card, improving from third place last year.",1
"We had record revenue of CAD 4.3 billion for the quarter, which is up 13% year-over-year, and we delivered strong operating leverage of 3.4% and an efficiency ratio of 56.5%.",1
Our late-stage delinquency rates across all of these portfolios continue to remain low and stable with the Vancouver and Toronto areas continuing to perform significantly better than our Canadian average.,1
You see that it has been unchanged if you take the four-quarter rolling average at 154 basis points to actual incidental and quarterly effects.,0
"Slide 26, you see that the income was flat compared to Q2 last year, but up strongly if you compare it with the first quarter this year, mainly driven by investment margin that was impacted by seasonally higher dividends.",1
"Turning to where lending then actually comes from, where the lending growth comes from, the net lending in Retail Banking has increased by ‚Ç¨3.5 billion and that's predominantly in Belgium, Germany and the rest of world, they all contributed to this growth.",1
That ratio is well in excess of the regulatory guidance of 10.5% for the group despite the partial deductions of the carrying value of the Insurance stakes.,1
"We've seen solid loan growth in Belgium, Germany, the Other Challengers & Growth Markets and CB Rest of the World.",1
"The net interest margin increased by 3 basis points from the second quarter to 146 basis points, and that was driven by Retail Germany and Retail Other Challengers & Growth Markets.",1
The underlying net result banking was ‚Ç¨1.123 billion and that was 37% from the third quarter last year and 22% from the previous quarter.,0
"The pre-tax result of Retail Banking increased 27% from the third quarter last year, and that's on the back of better volumes and better margins.",1
"In the second quarter, we grew core lending by ‚Ç¨6.4 billion, which is at the higher end of our loan growth guidance of 3% to 4% of the year.",1
"On a regulatory cost side, this was broadly unchanged, and we benefited somewhat from a downward adjustment of the DGS contributions in Belgium.",0
"The Net Promoter Score, as you know, is a very important compass for us to ensure that continuously we improve our customer services.",1
"You see that the commission income rose 8.2% from the first quarter of 2014 and 9% from the fourth quarter of 2014, and that is mainly due to higher industry lending fees, that's Commercial Banking, which is basically the fees that we collect when we close new deals, as well as higher fees in Retail Benelux and Retail Germany, and that's more on the sale of asset management products, which is also a kind of a seasonal phenomenon, people moving to asset management products in the first quarter.",0
"Furthermore, we have to absorb a significant amount of additional regulatory cost, as I mentioned already, and will be booked in the P&L later this year.",0
"Looking at the NIM, the ‚Äì we see lower margin in current accounts, and they have been offset by higher margins on savings, as a result of lower client savings rates.",0
And that's also supported by net releases for larger clients in Asia and the UK combined with some limited new additions during the quarter.,0
We now have the scale we need to compete across all our markets to develop options when adverse conditions arise and to embed value where we have opportunities.,-1

"We bought back 7 million shares, which we've issued in January for the scrip dividend payment and to be clear, we have just issued another 50 million scrip shares, which we'll bought back in the coming quarter.",0
"And last, but not least, the fifth segment of focus on which we have also made some strategic move is integrated gas and power.",0
"And this will be the thematic of my presentation now, which is in fact to capitalize on our strengths, to work on a future growth by taking advantage of the current market conditions.",1
"These have been ‚Äì I would say, this value proposal, what we put on the table to Petrobras, was absolutely as you see from their point of view, quite appealing, and they entered into that package deal.",0
"So, U. S., we recognize things are happening, but we want to develop a portfolio there but based on our strengths.",0
And Total's response is to continue to execute and deliver on a strategy that makes us more competitive in any environment.,0
"And I can tell you by doing this transition, how important it has been for me to have the strong support of the executive committee and to work with and rely on this talented, experienced team.",1
"Maybe the different way that some of our competitors of service companies, we consider that it will require not long time to train operators, technicians, engineers in the oil and gas industry.",0
"And the best growth is in Africa, where we went from 12% to 15% between 2012 to 2014, and we expect to exceed 16% market share in Africa next year.",1
"For the future growth in R&C, we are concentrating the investment on petrochemicals and targeting opportunities to take advantage of low-cost feedstock.",1
"On the same part of the slide, you see that the refining margin in blue increased by a factor of more than 2.5 to $48 per ton.",1
"And if we turn on top of that, transitioning from very intensive investment phase, production growing, we had OpEx savings across the board and we'll continue that, we understand why we are continuing to lower the breakeven.",0
"So, there again, as Patrick told you with initial target for 2015 was $800 million, we increased it beginning of last year to $1.2 billion, more than $1.2 billion, we told you.",1
"In lubricant as well, which is representing more or less 1/3 of the results, we have an improvement, an increase of 3%.",1
"Definitely, we need to be more aggressive in countries where you have natural growth and for us, it's mainly Africa and Middle East.",1
"The natural gas production performed an impressive 25% growth, mainly due to YSUR acquisition and our outstanding performance in the perforation of tight gas.",1
"Now I just mentioned ARS1 billion, that's a combination of the ARS800 million that was sold locally plus some exports.",0
"Third, ARS 1.6 billion increase in natural gas sales in the Retail segment which is mainly explained by our subsidiary, MetroGAS, on an increase in price of 145%, but lower volumes of 26% due to the milder weather in the fall and in the early winter.",1
"Then, there were higher exports of ARS 680 million on higher volumes and also higher prices, and we have diesel sales which were almost flat because we had a 4.5% increase in prices which was partially offset by a 4.1% reduction in sales volumes, and I'll explain that in a couple of slides.",1
"The business continues to show a strong cash flow from operations, which allows us to finance our capital expenditures and still maintain our cash cushion and an unlevered and strong balance sheet in our opinion.",1
"Third, an increase of ARS 2.9 billion in gasoline sales with higher prices also in pesos of 36% and lower sales volumes of 2.5%.",1
"First, greater crude oil purchases of ARS 5.2 billion on higher prices and lower volumes, as discussed before, and remember that most of these are purchases from our own Upstream segment.",1
"The Downstream segment reported an operating income of ARS 3.1 billion, which was 55% below the operating profit of the previous year.",0
"When we add these collections to the rest of the recurring operating cash flow, we show ARS 59 billion of adjusted operating cash flow in the year.",0
This was fueled by both the increased drilling activity and the reshaping and optimization processes we have been doing at a field level.,1
"It is also worth highlighting that in this year we have improved the mix of products sold, increasing the volume of sales of premium products by 25.6% and 24.6% for gasoline and diesel respectively.",1
"We have an account receivable for these two items of close to ARS 12 billion as of December 31, 2015.",0
"And during the year, we will be carrying out facility the bottlenecking initiatives, which will gradually result in an increase of production.",1
"With respect to prices at the pump, this quarter only was affected by a 6% increase in January and a similar increase is March.",1
Other highlights of the quarter include the final closing of the Chevron joint venture and consequently the entry of approximately an additional $650 million in December; the extension of concessions in the province of Chubut and our $500 million five-year bond issued in international markets.,1
It is already producing an interesting amount of oil and expectations reach an EOR in the order of magnitude of 1.5 million BOEs.,1
"Soon, we will also complete our first horizontal well in Bandurria, which is a concession that we had with several partners and we recently broke down in smaller pieces; and we now own 100% of a smaller block.",-1
"In terms of natural gas revenues, they were up by 85% in the quarter due to a 26% production growth and a 10% higher average sales price of $4.28 per million BTU.",1
"In this third quarter, total hydrocarbon production was flat vis-√†-vis a year ago, with a 1.3% growth in crude oil and net increase of 1.4% in natural gas production, which was affected by a few factors that we will cover in a few minutes.",1
"Those wells below the type curve were wells that presented different issues that prevented them from being completed, but that we expect to eventually complete them and improve their productivity.",1
"Mulichinco and Lajas differ substantially in terms of the cost of the wells as Mulichinco is only 2,000 meters deep, whereas Lajas formation is between 3,500 meters to 4,000 meters deep.",0
"And then to a lesser extent in the Golfo San Jorge basin in Manantiales Behr, El Tr√©bol, Los Perales, and Ca√±ad√≥n La Escondida.",0
"The additional point I want to make here is that if you look at the short light blue line at the left, those are the 24 wells drilled in the sweet spot this year and they are also delivering the same production results that the tight curve and that ‚Äì the one that we obtained in 2013 in the sweet spot.",0
"Costs increased by 54.5% compared with the same period of 2013, and we highlight here, first the increases in crude oil we transferred from YPF's Upstream business segment of ARS5.7 billion.",1
We‚Äôre very pleased to discuss the results of yet another strong quarter and to update you on a number of recent developments.,1
"Even more significantly, over the last five years, our F&D average less than $15 per BOE with the reserve replacement ratio of better than 150%.",1
"Our Gulf assets provide us a capital-efficient value driver, and our record production achievements at Constitution and K2 are great examples of that.",1
We expect stable conventional oil production from the Gulf of Mexico and our international assets and significant high-return oil growth to our Delaware and DJ.,1
"In November, we announced some changes to the construction of our compensation program when we communicated our initial thoughts on the 2018 capital investment plan.",0
"One that can continue to do what we do best, exploit our asset base to generate profitable production growth and increased shareholders value over time.",1
"In addition, our onshore North American crude oil production increased to nearly 120,000 barrels a day, an increase of 26% versus second quarter of 2012 and now comprises over 15% of our total production.",1
"In addition, we have prepared an operation supplement, which summarizes our activities and includes detailed well highlights across the various Apache operating regions.",0
"In all of our onshore regions we continue to do what Apache does best and that's reduce costs, increase production, driving returns.",1
"Regardless of how long oil prices remain depressed, we plan to emerge from this downturn as a top-tier resource company in terms of drilling inventory, operational efficiency, cost structure, and balance sheet strength.",1
"During the third quarter we brought on the Truman 28-6-6 #1H  which recorded a strong average 30-day IP rate of 1,949 barrels of oil equivalent per day.",1
"The primary reasons we are contemplating the change is because successful efforts is more commonly used by our comparable peers, creates less long term price related volatility on the balance sheet, and more accurately reflects the matching of expenses within the period in which they are incurred, especially as it relates to exploration expense.",-1
"As we turn our focus to 2016, strip oil prices are now roughly 30% to 35% below where they were a year ago.",-1
"Before I turn to other items, I'd like to comment on the reported production volumes which include a significant downward adjustment related to the Egyptian tax barrels.",-1
I would like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations.,0
"We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, continue to build high-quality development inventory for the future, and invest to improve long-term returns and create shareholder value.",1
"I will get to operational update in a couple of minutes, but before doing so I want to start today's call by addressing our shareholders.",0
"As a continued cost control measure, all full-time employee salaries and all annual retainers paid to our directors were reduced by 10% effective March 1, 2016.",1
"However, we continue to actively build on the 20% cost reductions we achieved in 2015 and strengthened the size and quality of our prospect inventory.",1
"Our third quarter results were reflective of these strategic objectives, and I'm particularly pleased that we have reduced our net debt by CAD 186 million so far this year.",1
"To highlight the quality of this asset, the Eagle Ford generated net operating income of CAD 118 million, with CAD 48 million of CapEx netting free cash of CAD 70 million on the quarter.",1
I would like to remind everyone that there are number of positive catalysts on the horizon that should contribute to sustained lower differentials and stronger heavy oil pricing going forward.,1
"Production on the acquired assets average 3,800 boes per day during the third quarter, up 26% from the time of the acquisition.",1
"In our Bakken/Three Forks resource play, reserves increased 55% to 53.5 million barrels due to an increased drilling density to five wells per 1,280-acre spacing unit versus three wells previously.",1
"In addition, these assets have significant future reserve upside potential from well downspacing, improving completion techniques, and new development targets in additional zones.",1
What the third quarter also shows is our ability to exceed growth expectations while producing record results in a tough price environment.,1
"Amphenol was awarded a $750,000 grant by the Delaware County Industrial Development Agency in New York for the construction of a natural gas pipeline from Constitution to their facility.",0
"On the strategic front, during the year we announced the divestiture of our lower return, non-core assets, as mentioned, West Virginia and also east Texas and the Eagle Ford for a combined proceeds of approximately $840 million, positioning us as a pure-play Marcellus company that offers pure leading production and reserve growth for debt adjusted share, return on capital employed, free cash flow generation, return of capital, and one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry with a net debt to EBITDAX ratio of one time and approximately $2.2 billion of liquidity, which will be further enhanced upon closing of the Eagle Ford transaction.",1
"And we'll remain opportunistic throughout the year given our significant financial flexibility, including over $925 million of cash on hand at the end of the first quarter pro forma for the April share repurchase activity.",-1
"Above all, we plan to maintain an ironclad balance sheet with ample liquidity, allowing for financial flexibility through all commodity cycles.",1
"As we await in-service for Atlantic Sunrise, we are fulfilling our obligation through a combination of various transportation paths for Cabot's gas combined with some third-party purchases.",0
"For the first quarter, we reported a net loss of $2 million attributable to our common stock or $0.05 per diluted share.",-1
"In light of prevailing low commodity price environment and as Todd noted, we took additional steps in the quarter to better align our workforce with a longer term or moderate price environment.",1
"To lead the team's operational growth moving forward, Shawn Kerns and Darren Williams will focus on production and margin growth as well as resource capture.",1
"We achieved record quarterly oil production of a 105,000 barrels per day on average, 5% higher than the third quarter of 2014 and 12% higher than the fourth quarter of the prior year.",1
"Largely as a result of the refining events, NGL realized prices decreased even more than crude prices in the first quarter falling to $21.55 per barrel down from $60.39 per barrel in last year's first quarter, a 64% drop; and from $34.41 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2014, a sequential decline of 37%.",-1
We're excited to increase activity in the Kettleman area as this is an Elk Hills analog with a large structure of stacked pay opportunities.,1
We have started and will continue to define this opportunity set over the coming year with workovers and new wells.,0
"This means that one well exposes us to multiple pay zones, allowing us to access additional reservoirs without having to drill a new well.",1
"Our team accomplished this through a combination of a debt exchange, open market purchases, limited debt for equity swaps, a cash tender and, importantly, free cash flow.",1
"We've allotted approximately 30 minutes for Q&A at the end of the call, and want to ask the participants to limit their questions to a primary question and a follow up.",1
"And we think we can do this while achieving an even overall or lower overall base decline rate, which will moderate and will continue through some period into the future.",-1
"Our activity will remain weighted to development of the Upper Wolfcamp B in the near term, but we are currently testing the Lower Wolfcamp B and Wolfcamp A, as Gary will discuss in more detail.",0
Page 13 provides an update on operational plans for 2015 and some early insight into our capital allocation for 2016.,0
"Finally, I will turn to Slide 14 which summarizes our updated production and cost guidance for the year and introduces similar guidance for the second quarter.",0
We will also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures today which we believe help to facilitate comparisons across periods and with our peers.,0
"Subject to completion of the new pipeline system, which will have delivery points in several locations along the Gulf Coast, we will have a commitment of 15,000 barrels per day for a multi-year term.",0
"Slide 10 shows dramatic improvements in our LOE costs over the last several quarters, with improvements in workover expense and realized benefits from investment in infrastructure.",1
"Over the past two years, we've made a concerted effort to get all of the new pads on LACT units and feed oil volumes directly into gathering systems.",0
"Last quarter, we discussed how our Lower Spraberry wells in Howard County were taking longer to clean up, with the larger frac designs and that we expected to revert to a smaller design that will enhance the near wellbore nature of the fracture network.",1
The underlying goal here is to ‚Äì is really focused on reducing the impact of re-fracking into wells that have been recently placed online.,0
"As a reminder, we report our production volumes on a two-stream basis, and our LOE would be below $5 per BOE on a three-stream basis, which is reported by many of our peers.",0
"On an EBITDA per BOE measure, we generated over $28 per BOE produced in the quarter, providing strong internal cash flow to fund our drilling programs.",1
"Our unhedged oil price realizations were approximately 91% of average NYMEX prices relative to 90% in the first quarter, and benefited from improvement in the Midland and Cushing basis differential.",1
"As we continue to execute on our plans, we currently forecast over 40% production growth over the course of 2017, with the fourth quarter exit rate approaching 30,000 BOE per day.",1
"Today's call is certainly a milestone event for the company, a call that finds the company in the final stages of its transformation to an onshore operator focused exclusively on the Permian Basin.",1
I will finish by saying that our program development operations have fully transitioned into manufacturing mode at our key fields.,0
"Oil production is comprised of 6,900 net BOPD from the Eagle Ford, 800 net BOPD from the Niobrara and 200 net BOPD of other.",0
"For gas and NGLs, fourth quarter production will range between $68 million to $75 net million Mcfe per day, representing or reflecting the sale of the Barnett Shale on October 31.",0
"Due to the continued strong performance of our EBITDA assets combined with the impact of the October Eagle Ford acquisition, we are increasing our 2014 crude oil production growth target from 57% to 63%.",1
2015 land CapEx rises to $45 million from $35 million due to larger than expected acreage acquisitions during the second quarter.,0
The flow through impact of this is what causes us to slightly increase the range of our full year cash G&A guidance.,-1
"We currently have a deep inventory of more than 700 net locations remaining in the core of the Eagle Ford Shale at well spacing of 330 feet to 500 feet, and see an additional 100 to 115 net locations at tighter spacing in areas we tested.",1
"The narrowing differential positively impacted our netbacks during the quarter, but this also had a negative impact on the refining results as heavy oil feedstock was more expensive and contributed to lower refining margins.",-1
"Secondly, we also have around NOK 1.1 billion in debt in Brazil; most of it will be part of the debt of new Aker Solutions.",0
"Historically ‚Äì or going forward, we're going to split the scope in line with what each of the parts are actually contributing.",0
"Hopefully, we are now reaching the run rate level going forward, but we will still have to monitor the cost base carefully until we get a stronger backlog.",1
"Then we had the divestment of Fjords to NOV for an enterprise value of NOK 1.2 billion, which gave an accounting gain of NOK 654 million booked under discontinued operations.",1
"Also, the charter rate on the vessel was increased to around $2 million per quarter after the transaction with Mitsui last year.",1
"We plan to continue our pilot work on the existing two wells, as we build the facilities at Phase A.
Christina Lake Phase F is 50% complete, and we are well into plant construction.",0
"For the first quarter, Cenovus reported cash flow of $1.19 per diluted share and operating earnings of $0.50 per diluted share, slightly less than the first quarter of 2013, but generally consistent with Street expectations.",0
These workforce reductions are directly related to a more focused pace of work in response to the continued low price environment.,0
"We believe this shift saved us approximately CAD 30 million in cash taxes overall, but resulted in a CAD 260 million or CAD 0.31 per share of incremental cash tax in the second quarter.",0
"Subsea closed many contracts that we have been waiting and preparing for, in Brazil, in Congo and in the North Sea, also MMO, Engineering and Umbilical has quite good order intake in the quarter.",1
We have incorporated learning from this project across all our SAGD operations to help improve reliability and maintain operating cost discipline; a fundamental principle of our business.,1
"MHWirth will of course continue to cut cost whenever necessary, but they believe that they had been through the worst and getting close to the cost base that will enable MHWirth to earn decent margins going forward.",-1
"In addition to the financial performance, Subsea started work on important contracts, including the Moho subsea field development in West Africa for Total, a framework agreement with Petrobras in Brazil, and a framework subsea service agreement with Statoil here in Norway.",1
"This is partially explained by weak results in the sub segment, mining and construction, as well as somewhat lower margins in the projects currently being executed.",-1
"In terms of a market outlook for Fjords, overall it still remains healthy as reflected in the high order intake, but this is something we are monitoring very closely.",0
"Process systems delivered a quite good revenue growth in the fourth quarter; however, the activity level is not balanced out on the regions causing capacity cost, and quite high tender cost in some regions.",1
"Oil represented approximately 57% of total production volumes compared to 65% in the successor period, primarily because of the full quarter addition of legacy Silverback production, which has a higher gas to oil ratio than legacy Centennial wells.",0
"As a reminder, in-basin sand has a significantly lower cost than traditional Northern White and we believe this will help mitigate any future service cost inflation in other areas of our operations.",1
"Importantly, our operations team was able to achieve the following, while driving down full-year unit costs and keeping D&C CapEx below the anticipated quarterly estimate.",1
"Oil production volumes for the quarter increased approximately 61% of total equivalent volumes compared to 59% in Q2, as our third quarter completions were more heavily weighted towards lower GOR acreage, and we had a full quarter of contribution from Lea County production that has a higher oil component.",1
"During the third quarter, we also began drilling our first Reeves County Bone Spring well, targeting the third Bone Spring carbonate interval.",0
"S. E.'s foothold in the Brazilian brownfield market, with Aker Solutions' size and maintenance and project execution capability is more important, will put us in a position to bid for larger contracts in these markets.",0
"At this stage, our outlook for 2017 indicates overall revenues down around 10% versus this year, with activity growth in Field Design, especially within MMO.",-1
"For reference, we have set out a table in the appendix that shows all the special items by quarter and year-to-date.",0
"G&A costs in the fourth quarter were $1.79 per boe, up from $1.71 in the third quarter due primarily to lower production volumes and the timing of other fees.",-1
"The subsea, umbilicals, engineering, and MMO businesses were spun off and listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange to become a new, leaner and more focused Aker Solutions.",0
"This visibility plus our continuous emphasis on operational improvements  spans (19:56) subsea in good stead for the future, although we do see some market headwinds that could offset some of our expected bottom-line improvements in the near term.",1
"Well, thank you for listening, and Svein will it take from here, giving more details in our first quarter numbers.",0
This backlog position continues to give us very good visibility into 2015 and also quite good visibility in the medium term.,1
"We reduced our cumulative reportable spill volumes by 42% compared to 2013, and I'm very proud of these two significant improvements in our safety and our environmental performance.",1
"All in all, we ended the quarter with an unadjusted net loss of NOK 250 million, equivalent to an earnings per share of negative NOK 0.83.",-1
"Our investing cash flows totaled NOK 392 million in Q4 and around NOK 1.3 billion for the full year 2015, mainly related to fixed assets and technology developments.",0
"Most importantly, our major projects are progressing to plan and we continue to see benefits from our improvement programs, but we do continue to face market headwinds in addition to the expected effect of higher depreciation.",-1
"In terms of order intake, our Q4 book-to-bill was down versus last year at 0.3 times, but backlog remains substantial at NOK 22.5 billion.",-1
"Importantly, our work on Sverdrup is very much on track, and we continue to believe that we are well-positioned to secure future phases of work with this important project.",0
"The drilling teams worked several records in the quarter having drilled our deepest well with a total measured depth of just under 21,000 feet.",-1
"We also put our three highest rate wells on line in the third quarter each reaching peak production rates of over 1,000 barrels of oil per day.",1
"With me on the call today are Doug Lawler, our Chief Executive Officer; Nick Dell'Osso, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jason Pigott, our Executive Vice President over the Southern Division.",0
"Our new company has taken its first steps, and our message of partnership along the value chain is clearly resonating.",0
This was driven primarily by lower volume which drove lower cost absorption and productivity versus the fourth quarter of 2016.,-1
We are on track with these cost actions and expect these to materialize and to improve TPS margins in 2019.,1
"Orders in the quarter were $1 billion up 30% year-over-year, the largest OFE orders quarter since the first quarter of 2015.",1
"At this time, we are projecting our LOE expense per boe of production to fall toward the lower end of our guidance range for the remainder of year.",0
"So, we continue to create additional margin beyond that which is afforded by the move in oil and NGL prices.",0
"But the largest factor was our increased work over activity primarily in the Permian, which by itself added a dime per Mcfe over 2012 average.",1
"Other current assets were $39.8 million, down from the year-end balance of $43.6 million, for the most part as a result of a decrease in income tax pre-payments.",-1
"Cimarex is now operating three rigs in Cana, one more operated rig has actually scheduled begin drilling later this month bringing our total operated rig count to four.",0
"This upside frac had a positive impact on the initial production, the recoverable reserves and most importantly on the returns.",1
grew over 60% compared to 2016 and at a faster pace than the 49% growth in 2017 for completion activity that's published by the EIA.,1
You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business.,0
"On the service cost side with the slowdown in industry activity, we continue to see a somewhat soft market in drilling and completion costs, although we see our overall total well costs that will quote in this call somewhat flat since our last call.",-1
"So after incorporating in our continued cost control efforts and also taking into account the fluctuating nature of workover expenses, we projected our remaining year lifting cost to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.75 per Mcfe.",0
"And then Larry will go over Core's two operating segments, detailing our progress and discussing the successful introduction of new Core Lab technologies and then highlighting some of Core's operations and major projects worldwide.",1
We are now investigating the role of dense and complex completion and stimulation programs and the role in the EOR process.,-1
Our partner continues to complete their wells with an expectation that all of these wells will be on production during the second quarter of 2017.,0
We do not anticipate any increase in our DSOs for the remainder of the year as we continue to focus on all important aspects of running the business during this difficult environment.,-1
"Our production calls for Q4 2017 exit rate in the neighborhood of 1.13 to 1.19 Bcfe a day, and that's a strong 18% to 24% increase over Q4 2016.",1
"Within the first quarter by month, we saw the impact of the weather and project delays roll out during the quarter as one would expect with February being our slowest month, as the weather had the greatest impact during that month.",-1
"Of this revenue, services for the quarter $188.7 million, up about 3% when compared to $182.5 million last year, or an increase of about $6 million.",1
"Furthermore, what we are learning from this pilot will have a meaningful impact and the design for our upcoming long lateral development in Leota Jacobs area, of which the exact timing is still being worked out, as well as future infill development across the rest of our Woodford acreage.",0
"In closing, with Q3 coming in better than expected, and Q4 projected to provide a nice ramp in production, we're forecasting solid 18% to 19% year-over-year production growth for 2017.",1
"Increases in global demand, increases in net decline curve rates and decreases in global inventories that have been occurring since July of 2016, coupled with steeply falling production in Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Angola, China and the North Sea have tightened global crude markets to the point where longer dated barrels on the futures curve have to increase in price to ensure greater international and deepwater investment for that future supply.",0
"EBIT, ex-items from continuing operations for the quarter was $32.7 million and continues to represent best-in-class EBIT margin of 19%.",1
"In understanding the Bernoulli equation and its impact on the drawdown pressure across an individual perforation, our engineers have been able to optimize the uniformity of the hole diameter around the production casing, reducing the friction pressure, resulting in lower hydraulic horsepower required for formation breakdown ‚Äì over 30% in some cases.",1
"And we expect fourth quarter international activity levels to be flat to up slightly from third quarter levels, with most ongoing projects to be funded largely from the operators' operating budgets.",1
Favorable gathering rates in Monroe County will help drive total Utica costs to $1.70 for the fourth quarter of 2017.,1
Our marketing team and existing firm transportation capacity enabled us to capitalize on certain first quarter key pinch points within the Northeast.,1
"We are investigating potential work for this rig once we have completed a shakedown with BP and I remind you all that, as of today, all of our sixth-generation assets remain contracted to 2019 and beyond.",1
"And finally, during the second quarter, we used our revolver to help fund the last payment on the Ocean GreatWhite, but we expect to pay down this balance in the coming quarters.",0
"In addition to substantially strengthening our balance sheet and significantly reducing our legacy liabilities, which Dave is going to cover in detail in a few minutes, last year, we IPO'ed a portion of our joint venture of Marcellus Gathering Systems into an MLP known as CONE Midstream Partners.",1
"Also, as previously announced in our December 14, 2014 press release and in anticipation of post CNXC IPO, we anticipated reducing our quarterly dividend starting in the third quarter.",0
"Interest expense should be $15 million to $20 million in Q2 and G&A expense should return to the range of $17 million to $20 million, all in line with amounts we indicated in last quarter's conference call.",0
"When you look to our Virginia coalbed methane field, we're becoming increasingly excited about the potential of applying advanced completion test designs across the multiple coal sinks.",1
"Looking at unit costs, even though our realizations have declined, our unit costs also declined as well and offset to keep our margins flat at $0.71.",-1
"In this quarter, our leverage ratio decreased to 3 times compared to 3.5 times at the end of the first quarter.",-1
"That said, due to timing associated with when those wells go online, we expect a production increase in the third quarter compared to the second and an even larger production increase in the fourth quarter.",1
"We had expected this rig to work in West Africa, but it is now being marketed in the Mediterranean and North Sea.",1
"Our recent accomplishments in our transformative journey, our execution plans in front of us and our philosophy of NAV per share on capital allocation, those things, they place us in a driver's seat to excel.",1
"First will be the operating cost for our new drill ship the Ocean BlackHawk, which operated for only the final portion of Q2 but will incur a full quarter's worth of cost in Q3.",0
So despite the commodity headwinds we expect to be free cash flow neutral in the fourth quarter 2015 and positive free cash flow in 2016 without any asset sales or dropdowns.,1
"And our debt structure continues to evolve to a much improved position when one looks at everything from rates to covenant flexibility, to access of a wider creditor capital pool.",1
"Depreciation of $86 million and interest expense of $21 million, both came in below guidance as result of the Ocean GreatWhite being placed into service later in the quarter than originally expected, which have delayed the start-up of depreciation expense and allowed us to capitalize a larger portion of interest cost.",-1
"We did experience some higher than usual per unit lease operating expense in the quarter, driven by water disposal cost related to our activity schedule with a lot of these costs coming out of Monroe County where our ability to reuse water has decreased due to our activities starting to roll off in this area, as we talked about at the Analyst & Investor Meeting.",-1
"But in summary, I can characterize our results as reflecting our ability to execute as it relates to both the operational performance of our fleet as well as on controlling costs.",0
"We often get asked when the separation could happen, and although we can't provide a definitive answer to the question, much of that timing will depend on what the commodity does.",0
"That said, as we alluded to in our release and recent announcements lowering our estimated 2016 coal sales guidance, there's volatility surrounding the timing of shipments due to high inventory levels of our customers.",-1
"With longer production history and additional well control, we'll be able to zero in on the optimal rate and time period that we can hold production flat.",1
"Excluding the impairment charge, adjusted net income was $62 million or $0.45 per share, compared to our first quarter 2017 results of $24 million or $0.17 per share.",-1
"The pricing structures for these deals provide value above pool sales on Columbia Gas Transmission, where much of the gas flowed prior to certain system enhancements.",1
"After surpassing our 18-month free cash flow plan at the end of 2016 and executing on our de-leveraging plan for this year, our balance sheet repair is nearly complete.",1
"The recent incremental leg down in commodity prices and uncertainty regarding the timing and degree rebalancing in the oil markets has caused our customers to announce further reductions in capital expenditures, the results of which is to push out the likely duration of the down cycle for the offshore drilling sector.",-1
"These cost savings, they've got a meaningful impact on our EBITDA and we are excited to continue making progress in this area.",1
"Higher levels of operational efficiency, including 99.6% operational utilization for our floater fleet, coupled with disciplined cost management drove these results.",1
"Notably, ENSCO 8503 was selected to execute the first exploration well drilled by the private sector, offshore Mexico, which resulted in a world-class discovery, beating out several other rigs to win this work.",1
"Excluding integration-related transaction costs, total contract drilling expense declined to $318 million in first quarter 2018, better than guidance of approximately $320 million and down $10 million in the prior quarter due to lower scheduled repairs and reactivation costs.",1
"Quite simply, everyone wins when companies like CNX are able to invest our own money into our assets, employees and regions where we operate.",1
"In addition to total satisfaction our customers rated Ensco number one in 11 other categories, including safety and the environment, performance and reliability, job quality, plus several other technical and geographical categories.",1
"On today‚Äôs call, I‚Äôm joined by Tim Leach, our Chairman and CEO as well as other members of our management team who will be available to answer questions.",0
"That oil growth was enough to push our overall crude oil mix up to 62%, which goes to show that our drilling efforts in the Delaware Basin are moving to needle.",1
"Exactly one year ago during the second quarter 2012 conference call, I outlined a plan that called for a strategic shift in our drilling program to accelerate the development of our more capital-efficient higher rate of return horizontal operations in the Delaware Basin.",1
"I promised I would talk to you about rates, so let's turn to slide 8 and take a look at what's driving our results in the Northern Delaware Basin.",1
"What sets us apart is our crude-oil-weighted production mix, and our focus on keeping cost as low as possible for a growth company.",1
"Clearly our activity level in the Northern Delaware Basin is very high and as you can see on slide seven, our results are very consistent.",0
"Between these three areas, we‚Äôre currently running nine horizontal rigs and we‚Äôll continue to add rigs here over the course of 2014.",0
"Gulf of Mexico, on the jackup side, we were able to find short-term work to fill gaps and utilization during hurricane season.",1
"We‚Äôre also having success with the horizontal Blinebry in the Yeso fairway, and later this quarter, we‚Äôll spud our first horizontal Blinebry in the southwest extension.",1
BridgeTex and another Longhorn expansion phase should begin flowing very soon while Permian Express II and Cactus should start following in the first half of 2015.,0
"Adjusted for the planned shipyard days in the second quarter related to upgrades and scheduled survey work, as well as cold-stacked rigs that are not being marketed, utilization was 98%.",0
"With a 20% reduction in cost at $60 oil, the rate of return for enhanced completions in the 2nd Bone Spring are comparable to the returns we generate at $85 oil.",1
"This is a direct result of our fundamental strategy to focus on our asset quality, program returns, balance sheet and our team.",0
"Cash flow exceeded capital spending for the fifth consecutive quarter and excluding acquisitions, we're on track to understand our cash flow by over $100 million before year 2016.",0
I've described the Wolfcamp as the next big play for Concho and we recently completed two wells targeting the upper Wolfcamp sands.,0
"Depending on commodity prices and resulting cash flow, we expect to invest between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in 2017 and grow oil volumes by more than 20% year-over-year.",1
"As noted in our press release, gains from the sale of two jackups ENSCO 69 and the Wisconsin reduced first-quarter contract drilling expense by $24 million.",1
"Since 2010, we have sold a total of 14 rigs at a pre-tax gain of approximately $90 million, and we've reinvested the proceeds back into our fleet.",1
"A disciplined capital program, non-core asset sales and a cash distribution from our equity investment in Oryx were the primary drivers behind the $320 million reduction in total debt during the first quarter.",0
"Since we've already know that March and April prices for bitumen are higher, we expect second quarter realizations to improve compared to the first quarter.",1
In the Kwanzaa basin in Angola we completed the second phase of our 3D seismic program in early April and we're still in planning mode to begin drilling early next year.,0
We signed a six-month extension with Shell in Malaysia for ENSCO 105 and are in discussions with customers for our jackups with remaining 2014 availability.,0
"Contract drilling expense was a bit higher than we forecasted, but this was more than offset by positive variances for other expenses.",1
"Through June 30, capital spending totaled $630 million, so the balance for the remainder of the year is $1.1 billion.",0
"As you can see, we had 37,000 BOE per day of additional downtime compared to last year, with 35 of that coming from our planned maintenance work.",-1
That's a 9% overall increase from the third quarter of last year and represents a 25% increase in crude oil prices over the same period.,1
"In closing, recovery in the offshore drilling sector continues to largely play out as we expected, with utilization in the shorter cycle Jackup segment rebounding ahead of the Floater market.",1
"That's growth of 4% or 69,000 BOE per day, which came primarily from liquids and from domestic gas sales at APLNG which will turn to LNG over time.",1
"And our seasonal turnaround activity started at both Prudhoe and Kaparik  in June, and will continue into the third quarter.",0
This proprietary system was developed with the support of several departments across the company and has been successfully implemented in the past year to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of our repair and maintenance processes.,1
"Now for the past 18 months we have lowered CapEx and OpEx levels across the company as prices have weakened, and we're doing it again in 2016, and that's shown on slide five.",0
"We're cutting other discretionary programs across the business, which are somewhat offset by anticipated cash calls in our equity affiliates.",0
First the pipe connector write-down was roughly $52 million as these connectors were purchased prior to the downturn in anticipation of continued strong growth in the U. S.,1
Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in this morning's press release and on our website.,0
So as an active finish to 2017 and we're entering 2018 with the same strong conviction about our value proposition.,0
"If we look at the fourth quarter, about 83% of our global oil production was priced either on a Brent basis or a premium marker that's closely correlated to Brent.",0
"Based on our current assumptions, we are confident that the revised dividend will be sustainable through the trough of the cycle and do not anticipate any further reduction.",1
"Moving on to page six, I will discuss in further detail some of the changes in the global offshore market we saw during the quarter.",0
"To remind you, we expect both our International Services segment and the offshore portion of our U. S. segment to grow at least to 10% for the full year.",1
"For our second quarter, we expect revenue to be between $270 million and $280 million and again an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40%.",0
"And today, we're announcing that under our existing leasehold in SCOOP, the company has added approximately 300,000 net reservoir acres to our portfolio with the Sycamore reservoir.",0
"Turning to operating cash flow, we've got two items that I'll call out that we wouldn't normally consider operating or free cash.",0
"Today, we are introducing our preliminary unit economic models for our acreage and STACK Meramec over-pressured oil window and the SCOOP Springer based on the results we've seen to-date.",0
$128 million of that comes from normal operations and $714 million resulting from the impact of the federal tax reform.,0
One such recent addition is David Brunnert who joins us with nearly 20 years of oilfield services experience and will serve as our Senior Vice President of Operations reporting to John Walker.,0
"We are improving both drilling and completion operations, maximizing margins through oil and gas marketing, including increased access to coastal markets for our premium Bakken crude oil and keeping transportation costs low.",1
"All remaining locations are classified as inactive, meaning there's no base or personnel and we see no near-term prospects that meet our business objectives.",0
"As a result, our production for the quarter hit record levels and our cash costs such as G&A and LOE came in significantly below guidance.",1
"On the Honeycutt project, approximately 37% of the production was crude oil compared with 12% oil cut for the Poteet wells.",-1
"While pleased with our progress to date, we're managing the company to achieve our financial and operational objectives in any commodity environment.",1
"Today, we estimate that for approximately $2.5 billion in 2016, we could grow in the mid to upper single digits from our 2015 exit rate.",1
The mix between rental equipments such as rotating cement heads and diverter subs and product sales such as centralizer subs has been relatively balanced and slightly favor the higher margin rentals.,1
"Also in this call, we will refer to initial production levels for new wells, which in most cases are maximum 24-hour initial test rates.",0
This will continue to be an area of focus for the remainder of the year as we drive to be free cash flow breakeven for the full year 2017.,0
"The Gulf of Mexico is likely to continue to remain relatively flat in terms of rig count for the remainder of the year, but adding these rigs will position us for growth in this market in 2018.",1
"We have more than 50,000 net acres with Woodford reservoir that is greater than 300 feet thick where this density drilling may be applied.",1
"Other completions of note include the Omer 1-17H and the Jerry 1-15H which had maximum test rates of 1,354 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and 1,052 barrels of oil equivalent per day, respectively, from laterals averaging 4,600 feet in length.",0
"As John Walker mentioned, we had sequential improvement in quarter two and have confidence that our revised strategy will drive improvement throughout the rest of the year.",1
"However, we believe that as activity levels continue to improve throughout the year, this pricing pressure will subside and our cost optimization initiatives will help offset any further pricing pressures on the service line.",1
We remain solidly on track for cash-neutral growth for the year as promised and continue to work diligently to sell non-strategic assets to reduce long-term debt to $5 billion target.,1
"Our corporate and other expense came in at $108 million this quarter, slightly lower than expected due to some insurance reimbursements for legal costs associated with the Macondo litigation as well as decreasing costs related to corporate initiatives.",-1
This is a great example of how our teams continually work to maximize the value of our top-tier assets for Continental shareholders.,1
"This relationship is the first of its kind, combining a proven inventory-rich operator with a leading royalty corporation to actively acquire and develop minerals.",1
So overall I'm very optimistic about Halliburton's relative performance as we move into 2014 and based on early conversations with our customers we are anticipating overall spend levels to increase.,1
"Beginning in the second quarter, we expect Eastern Hemisphere activity levels to recover from the seasonal impact and margins to steadily improve over the course of the year with full-year margins averaging in the upper teens.",1
"Based on subsurface well control and 3D seismic coverage, we see no other fault of this magnitude underneath our STACK acreage.",-1
"As I noted, we are currently completing our first STACK density pilot in the over-pressured oil window at the Ludwig unit.",0
"The Ludwig density pilot was our first opportunity to realize efficiency gains from pad development in STACK, and we reduced both drilling times and drilling costs for the new wells.",1
"Next, production expense guidance decreased to a range of $3.75 to $4.25 per Boe in comparison to the prior guidance of $4.25 to $4.75.",-1
"At the end of the first quarter, over 20% of our fleet has been converted to frac of the future, and we have largely completed the HALvantage rollout across our US land operations.",0
This area is outlined on slide 11 in our slide deck and stretches approximately 20 miles from our Verona well on the east to our Frankie Jo on the west and includes 55 Continental-operated units.,0
"We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the first quarter will be approximately $90 million, excluding acquisition-related costs, and this will be the new run rate for 2015.",0
"As we go forward in 2015, we're expecting the first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 28% to 29%.",0
U. S. rig count has dropped approximately 50% for the peak in late November and we're still seeing activity fall off week to week although the pace of decline has slowed.,-1
When you factor in our own equipment provides us with the utmost flexibility to adjust our capital spend based on our visibility of the market.,0
"There are currently 25 rigs targeting the STACK, Meramec and Osage reservoirs and approximately half of them are located in the over pressured window.",0
Now I want to address what we do as we scrape along the bottom and look ahead to the recovery.,0
"In Flat Lake, we drilled 14 net step-out wells by the end of the third quarter and have identified 220 new drilling locations within the Torquay, Three Forks, Midale and conventional Ratcliffe zones.",0
"Beginning in the first quarter 2017, we'll start reporting our for geographic regions, showing revenue only and will only report operating income by area, which is consistent with our major peer.",0
"Doing this will protect our balance sheet, gets us to 100% payout, and will enhance our long-term per share growth for our shareholders.",1
"If you look at chemicals, I think there's an interesting ‚Äì an interesting point is that, if we look at the total network of chemicals that we have across all continents, what we've seen is that the volume of chemicals has been fairly steady.",0
"Asia going strong on all the elements, so no significant deviations ‚Äì negative significant deviations from the top performers in 2012.",1
"That might be the time needed for obtaining permits, that might be the time needed for completing environmental impact studies, and it might also be the business model while we feel that maybe a phased approach is more appropriate from a capital disciplined approach than starting immediately with a huge capacity.",0
"And so as we started to put constraints on sand in terms of availability and cost, it's actually had a very rationale impact on driving thought around where it goes and how much in terms of total volume.",1
"In the Eastern Hemisphere, we achieved a modest improvement in activity in the third quarter but the landscape remains challenged.",1
"Pricing pressure and cost cutting remain major themes, and the use of technology to lower the cost per BOE is ever more important.",0
And we also closed a small acquisition at the end of July to add to our Flat Lake assets and our Torquay assets.,-1
"During the first nine months of the year, we should expect revenues and profits to be higher compared to the same period in 2013 due to the addition of the H534 and also having a full three quarters of the Skandi Constructor.",0
"The encouraging news we have now is that with the H1 results, take into account the stable occupancy rates, take into account the actions we have been taking, we strongly believe that we are well positioned to end up in this year beyond the ‚Ç¨700 million.",1
"Of course, the increase of the net debt EBITDA ratio was absolutely the result of not being able in the last one-and-a-half year to further grow the EBITDA level.",1
"Our net G&A related to stock-based compensation was approximately $3 million this quarter and we currently expect our G&A for 2018 to remain in the lower $20 million range per quarter, with stock-based compensation representing roughly $3 million to $5 million of that amount.",0
"As I said, if you correct for foreign exchange as you clearly see on the slide, you have a comparable performance a year ago at much lower occupancy rates.",0
This is a significant positive series of transactions that improves our balance sheet and also provides incremental value to our shareholders.,1
"However, after adjusting for $9 million of severance costs in Q1, G&A would be a couple million lower than the $27 million expense for Q4.",0
"As I mentioned, we expect to fund our capital program and dividends this year with cash flow from operations and in 2014, we generated approximately $107 million of excess or free cash flow.",0
Interest expense net of amounts capitalized was down about $2 million from Q3 due in part to capitalized interest being about $1 million higher in Q3 or about $7 million this quarter.,-1
"We have then narrowed that range between ‚Ç¨760 million and ‚Ç¨800 million, and we had to come back on that.",0
"We had $301 million outstanding on our bank credit facility at the end of 2016, in line with our expectations and leaving us with nearly $675 million in available liquidity under the facility.",1
Our net G&A related to stock-based compensation was approximately $3 million this quarter and we currently expect our G&A for the remainder of 2018 to remain in the lower $20 million range per quarter with stock-based compensation representing roughly $3 million to $5 million of that amount.,0
"As a consequence, we will take over first of all operatorship of the existing terminal, which is 509,000 cubic meters, which is there for the importation of fuels into Panama, but in addition to that, it is our plan to build another 360,000 cubic meters in the second phase to be able to serve the markets for marine products in the Panama market.",1
"One step further, if we look at the EPS development significantly affected, of course, by the total exceptional items, which are equaling ‚Ç¨200 million, we also have, let's say, explained that we have taken an impairment on our Estonian activities.",-1
"It's a three-year contract plus options to provide ROVs and tooling and personnel onboard McDermott support vessels similar to our ongoing agreement with Technip, which we won in 2012.",0
"Following suit, we have tweaked our EPS guidance upward a bit and are now providing $1.65 to $1.75 range depending upon our tax rate.",0
We also increased the certainty around 2014 cash flow and converted some of our 2014 collars to swaps and we've started to do the same thing in 2015.,1
"If you recall one of the reasons we elected to do first CO2 floodings at several of our fields was to give us the opportunity to first pursue these conventional projects, which we believe generate an attractive rate of return and also increase the amount of oil we ultimately recover.",1
"Total production for the quarter came in at just below 71,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, roughly flat with Q3 as growth at number of our tertiary floods was offset by non-tertiary declines.",1
"Our capitalization metrics remained solid, as our debt-to-capital ratio was approximately 38% at quarter end and our debt to 2013 EBITDA was about 2.4 times, and it would have been about 2.2 times if the Delhi remediation and other non-recurring items were excluded.",0
"And once the last bit of punch list items are completed, she should set sail undertoe to the Gulf of Mexico in mid-May.",0
"On to slide six, we booked an additional loss on the sale of ERT in Q1 in the amount of $22.7 million, mainly associated with the increase in the book basis from the end of 2012 to closing and severance cost related to the divestiture.",-1
Production facilities revenues and gross profits are there for your review as well as they've always been in the prior quarters.,0
"We've taken our time to plan and we'll take our time in executing the plan, but we're just at the beginning.",0
"On a sequential quarter basis, this is $1.56 lower than our base LOE in Q4, primarily due to lower CO2 costs and utilization.",0
"Hopefully, you all have had an opportunity to review our press release and related slide presentation materials released last night.",1
"As of quarter end, access to our revolver restricted, but we expect this to change over time as our performance improves and we continue to pay down debt.",-1
We have recently seen the LLS premium expand to proximately $6 above the WTI prices which is considerably higher than the $1 to $2 premium we have experienced over the last couple of years.,0
"Going forward, we expect our DD&A expense will increase to around the $55 million range or slightly higher for the third and fourth quarters of 2017.",-1
All of that in addition to CO2 will be sold under long-term contracts as I said the demand for CO2 in the Permian is very strong.,1
"Today, of course, we're still curtailing customers including our own oil production activities in the Permian Basin, that's how strong the demand is for CO2 in the Permian.",-1
"Turning to slide 6, our Well Intervention utilization was at 73% in Q1, slightly down from 74% in Q4 2017.",-1
"In the meantime, I'd like to give you a flavor of the types of ideas we are pursuing to enable us to flood our fields at significantly lower costs.",1
"Right now, we believe they could lead to capital expenditure opportunities on an  8H (10:52) basis of well over $2 billion over the next few years and would result in increasing our CO2 sales and transport volumes by about 800 million cubic feet a day by 2017, taking them up from around 1.2 a day moving to the Permian Basin to about 2 Bcf a day.",1
"For the full-year 2013 we expect to declare dividends of $5.33, that's up 7% from the full year 2012 and $0.06 above the $5.27 target in our budget for 2013.",1
"Our best estimate would be that the overall industry pace of construction for the U. S. market would slow to approximately 75 AC drive rigs during calendar year 2013, delivering a total of about half of 2012's effort.",-1
"And of course our biggest project is in Canada, the $5.4 billion Trans Mountain expansion unchanged from our last update, but we did cross a key milestone in the quarter.",0
"Our project execution has been exceptional, with the Delhi NGL plant progressing on-budget and on-schedule for start-ups later this month.",1
"As a result of the exceptional performance of our FlexRigs in the Middle East and Latin America, we believe there is long-term growth potential for international land operations.",1
"Looking at EPB's calculation of distributable cash flow, which is also reconciled to GAAP net income, DCF per unit is $0.75 for the quarter; comparing that to the $0.65 distribution, we've got coverage of about $21 million in the quarter.",0
"Moreover, as some of our rigs that are under term contracts rolled off these contracts and as announced new builds are deployed under new term contract, we expect the average pricing of remaining rigs that are currently under term contract to slightly increase during fiscal 2014.",1
This was primarily the result of a decrease in our hedge settlements and lower revenues due to lower realized prices.,-1
"In addition to the open market purchases of debt completed in Q1, we recently spent around $14 million to repurchase an additional $20 million of our senior subordinated notes.",0
"On the $54 million, we posted margin of about $60 million, and then we had a whole host of other items that comprised the difference to get you to $54 million increase in debt.",1
"But until we get our capital funds allocated and our forecast updated, I won't be able to give you a more precise production estimate.",1
This is primarily due to the full impairment of goodwill during the quarter as a significant portion of that goodwill had no tax basis.,-1
"Expansion CapEx, acquisitions, and contributions to equity investments were about $1.1 billion in the quarter, and then we made a CPC  settlement payment of about $319 million for a cash outflow of $5.5 billion.",0
"Double H is a 485-mile pipe extending from the Dore Terminal in McKenzie County, North Dakota, along the North Dakota/Montana boarder down to Guernsey, Wyoming where it ties in to Pony Express.",-1
"Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to decrease by about 32% quarter-to-quarter, and given the current trend, we could have approximately 150 rigs or less generating revenue days by the end of the quarter.",-1
We also have somewhat similar characteristics in some of our other assets in our portfolio and that's what's contributing to this large change in revenue and OpEx.,0
"Craig will give you a more thorough update on this release ‚Äì on the release we experienced at Delhi in June, but I'd like to make just a few comments on it.",0
"Excluding the Delhi charge, our overall and tertiary lease operating expense came in better than we expected and improved sequentially on a per BOE basis from Q1.",1
"Our overall DD&A per BOE decreased to $18.82 in the second quarter, from $19.65 per BOE in the first quarter.",1
"Our capitalization metrics remain solid, with our debt-to-capital ratio at approximately 38%, and our debt to Q2 annualized adjusted cash flow and EBITDA, excluding the Delhi charge, at about 2.1 times and 2 times, respectively.",1
"We intend to remain opportunistic with our share repurchase program, and we have approximately $224 million still authorized to spend under this program.",1
The decline in average rig revenue per day was attributable to softer market conditions and mutually beneficial temporary day rate reductions for some rigs that are under long-term contract.,-1
"Including these remaining contracts and combining all three of our drilling segments, we have an average of 118 rigs under term contracts to be active in fiscal 2016, 93 in fiscal 2017 and 52 in fiscal 2018.",0
Higher than forecasted production and lower pre-tax costs were the key drivers that allowed us to comfortably exceed Wall Street's expectations for the quarter.,1
"79 rigs during the second half of fiscal 2016, 66 rigs during fiscal 2017 and 34 rigs during fiscal 2018.",0
"The effective income tax rate for first quarter of fiscal 2016 was higher than expected, primarily as a result of adjustments related to recent tax law change, extending bonus depreciation allowances that expired at the end of 2014.",1
"As mentioned in the past, we expect our total annual depreciation expense for fiscal 2016 to be approximately $580 million and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $135 million.",0
"In the second quarter we brought 29 Bone Spring wells online, with average 30-day IP rates of 675 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which more than 65% was light oil.",1
"Finally, before I hand the call off to Dave, I'd like to briefly review our recent announcement to combine substantially all of our U. S. mid stream assets with Cross Techs  to form a new mid stream business.",0
"It is also important to note that for the full year, our total capital spending which includes E&P, Midstream and corporate capital remains on track to be near the midpoint of our guidance we provided at the beginning of the year.",0
"This will likely narrow the volatile price differentials we've seen on Canadian crudes over the past few years providing a catalyst that should further enhance our profitability in 2015, and beyond.",1
"But there have been recent controversies, as you all know, surrounding new pipeline projects, and I'd like to offer my perspective.",0
"On an apples-to-apples basis, our full year guidance have not changed from the updated guidance we gave you last quarter when you excluded the impact from the 50% sale of SNG.",0
"But I think at least the longest Dave, correct me if I am wrong, the latest data still the average lateral is still just around 7,000 feet.",0
"We use similar tools for all of the performance metrics that are vitally important to adding value for customers, like drilling performance, rig moves and trip times to name a few.",0
We ended up with only 3% of the barrels turned back and those were taken up in an open season.,1
"I hope you've had a chance to review all these documents, as today's call will largely consist of questions and answers.",0
"So, in summary, we are pleased with the way Devon is positioned to successfully weather the current environment and prosper in the future.",1
"But it became prohibitively expensive with the events of the weekend energy markets after the oil collapse and thus, in December 2015, we cut our dividend.",-1
The costs that we are incurring to repair our assets and that we expect to be reimbursed by insurance subject to the deductible are included in the certain item.,0
"By the same token, reduced cost flows through to the benefit of shippers and our shippers benefit from any other portions of our costs that are capped if we ‚Äì and we absorb the overrun, if any.",1
Our FlexRig upgrades enhanced the capabilities in useful lives of our existing fleet and enabled us to provide value and meet customer needs today and into the future.,1
"While there has been tremendous volatility in energy markets over the past year, I have unwavering conviction that these strategic actions were the correct long-term decisions for Devon.",-1
"And in the second quarter, we secured acceptable financing for our Trans Mountain expansion project, creating a self funding entity, KML, on the strength of all of our Canadian pipeline and terminal assets.",1
"Coupled with our investment-grade ratings and $2.1 billion of cash on hand, we have the financial capacity to execute on our business plan.",0
"These successful efforts resulted in record-setting wells results that drove our U. S. oil production above guidance expectations, with a capital investment that was 17% below our budget year-to-date.",1
"Given our ability to organically fund capital requirements, Devon is uniquely positioned to maintain and build momentum in the future as we advance our development programs in the STACK and Delaware Basin.",1
"Between the STACK and Delaware Basin alone, we have exposure to over 30,000 potential drilling locations concentrated in the very best portions of these plays.",0
"First of all, on a very positive note, our board today made some important personnel decisions that I believe will benefit KMI for years to come.",1

"While valuations of some midstream MLPs seem to have decoupled from crude prices to some extent including NuStar, which has generated a total unit holder return of 81% since our recent low on January 20, we believe that our valuations still does not yet reflect our solid financial results, stable cash flow and the overall stability and strength of our business.",1

This is a slight increase from the reduction announced in May as we continue to review the vessel schedule to optimize utilization of the remaining fleet.,1
"Secondly, we are faced with reengineering a field late in the project phase, which is a costly and inefficient process.",-1
"ONEOK's first quarter net income was $113 million or $0.54 per diluted share, compared with $123 million or $0.58 per diluted share for the same period last year.",0
"We ended Q3 with another backlog of $9.4 billion, after taking account of a negative $300 million foreign exchange impact on the order book.",0
"Operating costs were slightly higher, compared with the second quarter 2012, primarily because of higher pension expenses and property taxes, which were mostly offset by lower share-based compensation expenses.",-1
"We do not expect to recover ethane from our Williston Basin plants in 2014 and 2015 as originally planned, which will reduce our planned throughput on the Bakken NGL Pipeline by approximately 30,000 barrels per day in 2014 and by approximately 40,000 barrels per day in 2015.",-1
"Our natural gas distribution segment performed well during the quarter, benefiting from new rates in all three of the states it serves.",1
Propane inventories are decreasing in both Conway and Mont Belvieu from extensive seasonal demand from pud drying in the Upper Midwest and from strong export demand.,1
"Our adjusted EBITDA of $250 million was lower than the prior-year period, as our mix of work has been able to reflect the more price competitive projects awarded in the downturn.",1
"We now expect it to fall in the range of 25% to 28%, 3 percentage points lower than previously guided.",-1
"Upon closing, the proceeds from these sales will replenish our cash balance and will be available to fund an acceleration of our activities in the Anadarko Basin at the right time.",0
Net operating income of $109 million for the quarter stated after deducting depreciation and amortization of $97 million as well as impairment charges totaling $36 million mainly attributable to the Seven Polaris.,-1
"ONEOK Partner's second quarter net income was approximately $214 million or $0.54 per unit, compared with $202 million or $0.62 per unit in the second quarter of 2013.",0
"Demand for the Life-of-Field remains strong, particularly in the UK sector of the North Sea but IOCs and independents continue to invest in existing fields.",1
"ONEOK continues to benefit from its pure play general partner strategy with $633 million in distributions declared by ONEOK Partners in 2014, a 16% increase from the same period last year.",1
"So, we have several key priorities: First, we're focused on delivering the three-year plan we laid out for you earlier this year.",0
"In SURF and Conventional, we continue and still expect to continue to see and still expect a gradual market recovery with an increase in awards by 2018.",1
Our recent wells have estimated gross EURs of more than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent and we've raised our type curve in the Williston earlier this year.,1
"This week, we reached a significant milestone related to the West Texas LPG pipeline system, as we completed the transition of operation to ONEOK Partners from Chevron.",0
We can identify the specific geological features that can lead to inconsistent or poor well performance as well as superior performance.,-1
We completed operated wells with an average working interest of 77% compared to the average in our budget of 70%.,0
The partnership continued even in the face of sustained ethane rejection to increase our natural gas liquids volumes gathered and fractionated.,1
"This was affected by the net foreign exchange gain of $23 million this quarter from functional currency movements, which we report within other gains and losses.",1
"Our undrawn credit facilities together with our cash position, enable us to take a long-term view of the business and address appropriate strategic investment opportunities that may arise.",1
The Partnerships' 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance is $1.88 billion and we expect distributions declared at $3.16 per unit in 2016.,0
"We've been successful in our strategy to new markets such as Mexico closer to supply areas, such as West Texas and in the Mid-Continent.",1
"In the Southern Hemisphere and Global Projects business unit, third quarter revenue $670 million and net operating income was $185 million, down 30% and 12%, respectively, on the prior-year period.",0
"A long-term contract with BP in the Caspian was one in the first quarter, and in May, we added chartered vessel MMA Pinnacle to our fleet for IRM activity offshore Australia and Asia.",0
"This includes a full year's contribution from the ECS acquisition, offset by lower expected revenues in Renewables and Heavy Lifting, as the Beatrice wind farm project reaches completion.",0
"Walt will review our financial results and provide additional color on our 2017 guidance, which was updated to reflect the merger transaction and our business outlook for the rest of 2017.",0
"As Walt discussed, we've announced nearly $0.5 billion of capital growth projects with the most recent being the $200 million expansion of the West Texas LPG pipeline into the prolific Delaware Basin, one of the fastest growing plays in the U. S.",1
Our tailored approach to completion designs by project area has resulted in strong economics from the deepest part of the basin to the edges and we‚Äôre very proud of that.,-1
The result is reduced in-water time and quick and simple imaginary internal coercions and cracks without extensive training or equipment thereby saving time and money.,-1
"As Terry will discuss later, we are well on our way to securing the supply commitments to make this pipeline economically viable.",0
"To account for these higher costs in the first half of the year, we have updated our full year range to $8.50 to $10 per Boe.",0
"We have delivered another quarter of strong operational and financial performance in a business environment, which remains challenging due to this difficult downturn in oil and gas investments.",-1
"The second key contributor to our strong margin has been our consistently good execution, which has resulted in fewer cost overruns and success in derisking our projects.",1
The third-party infrastructure was either not able to take-off the produced gas or infrastructure was not placed when the wells came online.,1
Our updated stand-alone cash flow before changes in working capital is expected to exceed capital expenditures and dividends by a range of $115 million to $145 million versus our previous guidance range of $155 million to $195 million.,0
"We continue to expect that the current pace of integrated FEED studies will lead to direct project awards in the future, expanding both the customer base and geographical footprint for integrated projects.",0
"While we don't have any formal update on timing, we're continuing to process ‚Äì the process to potentially monetize these assets and are exploring numerous options and we will give you an update when we have something more definitive.",0
"In recent weeks, we have seen Conway to Mont Belvieu ethane price differentials narrow to breakeven level due to the continued Gulf Coast ethane inventory overhang and Mid-Continent buying interest due primarily to ethane rejection in the Rockies and Mid-Continent.",-1
"On the natural gas liquids side, we continued to work with land owners, state and local agencies, and other stakeholders along the pipeline routes for Elk Creek and Arbuckle II, and we expect to begin construction later this year on both projects.",0
"We ended the year with a revolver balance of $138 million and with proceeds from our January equity offering, that facility is undrawn today.",0
"All of our operations performed well, meeting or exceeding operational margin performance while identifying cost reduction opportunities for the benefit of future periods.",1
"With that acquisition, ONEOK became the sole owner of West Texas LPG, a strategic step in our broader Permian Basin strategy and further positioning us for expansion opportunities some of which are in the late stages of negotiations.",-1
Earnings at WMB however for the quarter were impacted by higher DD&A including an additional $17 million of non-cash amortization related to the ACMP acquisition.,0
"While vessel utilization is typically lower in the first quarter of the year due to seasonal factors, the 60% utilization rate for the first quarter was down from the 68% level achieved in the prior year.",-1
"Production on these design improvements is early time, so we don't have a lot of concrete results to share, but the early results from our wells supplemented by those weather operators in the basin give us confidence to continue to push our program with higher average proppant loads going forward.",1
So we remain very disciplined around the strategy and it really is a very strong compass for us in decisions we make.,1
We executed to joint venture agreement with Boardwalk Pipeline Partners to continue to developing this project and we've designed Bluegrass to transport natural gas liquids from the Marcellus and Utica Shale plays to the rapidly expanding petrochemical and export complexes on the U. S.,1
So really only about 13 days of profit in the third quarter associated with the business interruption claim that we submitted for the third quarter.,-1
"As you know, we're the leader in providing access to subsea wells through our riserless light well intervention technology and our footprint.",0
"We did see our volumes reach an average about 1.9 Bcf per day for the full year, and of course, our actual volumes are well above that now.",1
"As you probably know, the Dakota Access Pipeline or DAPL is now online and its contribution to basin takeaway capacity is making a significant impact on basin wide differentials.",1
"I think, oil, gas, power and petrochemicals, the areas with solid investment, and we're going to see investments in the very near future.",0
On our fee-based revenues and I think also or well over 80% of our reported net revenues were coming from fee-based services in the period.,0
"And today, the result is that that strategy is bringing us back to the Middle East, and we are one of the main suppliers in the onshore and refining to our main customers in the Middle East, which a good execution, good strategy, repeating to the customers give us a business today to face 2016 and 2017 far more resilient than other businesses.",1
"It's the year of procurement and engineering  we happen to do (12:27) construction, we have to deliver, and we will deliver our Canadian job this summer, sort of we have to do a lot of procurement and it's not a bad market to do procurement, and we have to do a lot of engineering.",0
The Access team continues its great performance as we have all come to appreciate this team's ability to steadily grow its volumes and cash flows as it connects gas supplies in some of the most prolific basins in the U. S.,1
"So, truly a very exciting time here as we merge these MLPs and really turn this into the MLP and the major integrated group and particularly one that's well-positioned as we've talked about before with a strategy that is so focused on natural gas.",1
"And if I have to say what how do I see the market, how do I see the future awards for 2013 and 2014, I have to be positive.",1
"But at that point in time, we couldn't grow in different countries as we had problems of being able to execute in the Middle East, the first large projects.",-1
"We continue to benefit from our Ventura marketing arrangement, as our realized gas marketing exceeded AECO pricing by more 45%.",1
These royalty transactions are beneficial for the company because there's a negligible amount of production impact associated with the sales and they go for good metrics.,1
"First of all, the Transco Virginia Southside, as I mentioned earlier, was placed into service in September of 2015, and of course, we look forward in the fourth quarter here to see the benefit of a full quarter there rather than just the one month.",1
We also announced in our release this morning that our 2014 capital budget has been revised from CAD 900 million to CAD 820 million to reflect the reclassification of CAD 80 million of the budget from capital expenditures to operating expense in connection with the restatement of certain of our historical financial statements.,0
"I mean, having delivered even jobs with problems, even jobs with financial difficulties that have been delivered  within acceptable (11:47) schedules.",-1
"Consequently, we have more than adequate liquidity to meet our upcoming May 29, 2016 senior note maturities of C$185 million.",0
"Our annual production is expected to remain unchanged between 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 64,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day after the effect of property dispositions closed during the first quarter and including approximately 3,900 barrels of production associated with the Slave Point disposition.",-1
"Our continued focused on a clear strategy, project execution and cost management are evident in our results and very importantly despite the pressures impacting the industry, we once again saw the dramatic growth in our fee-based revenues offset the impact of continued lower commodity prices.",1
"We will not take questions related to the pending transaction between Williams and ETE or related matters, and we thank you in advance for your cooperation for that request.",1
"As I said, it is rolling year at awards which means that if every quarter you put together what has been the last 12 months awards trying to see the tendency of the market, how we have behaved over the last three years.",0
"Simply put, if it would cost us more capital to bring disruptive production back on line than we expect it recover in the future, we made the decision not to spend those dollars.",-1
"And we continue to see some great execution on all these projects that we have coming to fruition and tremendous amount of work going on up and down the system right now, particularly, on the Transco system, as we expand that out to meet all the growing demands there.",1
It is a privilege to step into Dave's shoes with a table that has been nicely set for the next stage of our journey.,0
"Looking forward in the Cardium, our preliminary 2017 plans contemplate spending the bulk of our total development capital in the Pembina and Willesden Green areas.",0
"Secondly, we plan to bolster water injection in surrounding areas to elevate reservoir system pressure in preparation for 2018 development activity and beyond.",1
"And if you adjust for the sale of a couple of isolated gathering systems last year, they gathered about 90 million a day; volume growth would have been closer to 6.5% on that same comparison.",1
"Given the last few years, we're very pleased with the continued progress in El Dorado and the ability to meet market demand and increase productivity in production as we've done that.",1
"Adjusted operating income was a slight loss of $866,000 or 2.6% of revenue as profits overseas were offset by losses in the United States.",-1
"Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was 15% of revenue, which we believe to be the best of all the decommissioning service companies in the Gulf of Mexico.",0
"As a percent of revenue, however, adjusted EBITDA improved to 29.2% in the fourth quarter from 24.8% in the third quarter and compares to 20.83% in the fourth quarter from a year ago.",1
"During this conference call certain references to non-GAAP terms maybe made and participants are directed to Penn West's MD&A and financial statements available on our website, as well as filings available on the websites noted earlier to review disclosures concerning non-GAAP items.",0
"The adjusted EBITDA for the Atlantic Gulf came in at $431 million, a $3 million decrease from the third quarter of 2017, the year-over-year comparisons were impacted by the short-term benefit we had in Q3 of last year, where we were gathering and processing gas for a competitors Pascagoula plant and so that we had a big lift in the third quarter of last year's or remember where we pointed out.",-1
"Normalizing for the equity reimbursement of G&A, adjusted EBITDA that reflects the core earnings of the business increased sequentially by $1.7 million.",1
"Free cash flow in the first quarter for TETRA and excluding CSI Compressco, but including the distributions received by TETRA from CSI Compressco, was $6.1 million, an improvement of almost $20 million over the first quarter.",1
"In the Viking, the teams were able to accelerate plans second quarter completions and tie-in activity due to dry spring conditions.",1
"And just to remind you, we are planning an Analyst Day event in May where we'll dive deeper into our growth drivers for the future.",0
"Moving to DCF, we have a range of $2.9 million to $3.2 billion and the midpoint of the range represents an 8% growth over 2017.",1
"First, the timing of some of our larger projects through the second half of the year has been delayed and led to a deferral of collections.",-1
So we are really impressed with some of the production rates that we're seeing some from some of the new pads that we're just now turning on.,1
"And to aid us in this exercise, we are currently completing two externally reported business process reviews which Dave referred to in his opening remarks.",0
I remain optimistic that we can continue this positive momentum by transacting on additional non-core asset sales at attractive metrics.,1
"First, 18 months ago we launched an initiative to right-size the Offshore Services division and identified $15 million of cost savings on a business with an EBITDA run rate of $40 million to $45 million.",0
"The decrease in Q2 FY 2017 is mainly on an account of decrease in workover expenditure, which is also INR 196 crore, water injection and  dissolving (14:23) and diversification INR 50 crores, consumption of material INR 76 crore and transportation increased by INR 87 crores, which was offset by increase in stock expenditure, repairs and maintenance, fuel and power, other expenditure, administrative overheads, et cetera.",1
"The survey expenditure during nine months FY 2014 increased by rupees INR 181 crore is mainly due to higher survey activity in nine months FY 2014, which is partly offset by a lesser unsuccessful well cost, INR 48 crore in nine month FY 2014.",-1
Throughput volumes related to these projects also generate higher fees per barrel due to the specialized nature of the handling required for these projects.,0
"This segment benefited, primarily, from the increased contribution from the LPG storage facilities due to the return of some recent capital investments and rail capabilities at these facilities, as well as the acceleration of some project work into the third quarter.",1
"Our Hawaii retail operations had an excellent quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $8.8 million up nearly 80% over last quarter, when rising crude oil prices crimped our retail gasoline margins.",1
"Net debt for CSI Compressco declined by $5 million, from $504.7 million at the end of June to $499 million at the end of September, reflecting the stronger free cash flow generation.",-1
"In addition, successful execution of optimizing our available capacity resulted in a 13 percentage point increase in storage utilization over prior year to 97%.",1
"Now turning to our Global Marine Terminals segment, we recorded adjusted EBITDA of $53.7 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to $35.5 million in the comparable quarter last year.",0
"We use derivatives to manage our cost of our internally consumed crude, which is a major cost to our refinery.",0
One way we do this is through our participation in the Association of Oil Pipe Lines; in American Petroleum Institute industry trade associations; and our pursuit of continuous improvement in the areas of pipeline safety and emergency response.,1
"As I noted, there were several factors in our Fluids Division that were exceptional and should not be viewed as the ongoing run rate.",1
"Due to the continued strength of our fluids business, expected improvement in Production Testing, the improvement as we go through the year and go into our strong quarters in Offshore Services, as well as the go-forward impact on the cost actions delineated by Elijio.",1
Our average pipeline transportation volumes increased 3.3% to 1.46 million barrels per day compared to 1.4 million barrels per day in 2017.,1
"As discussed in last quarter's call, in January 2018, we repaid in full the $300 million principal amount and $9.1 million of accrued interest outstanding on our 6.05% notes using funds available under our credit facility.",1
"Consolidated and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the first quarter was $46.3 million and compares to $26.2 million in the first quarter, driven by increased demand across all business lines, better pricing, higher equipment utilization, the European fluid seasonality, and a full quarter of the SwiftWater acquisition.",1
"The addition of Digital Petrodata allows TGS to now offer a digital GIS reference database on producing oil and gas fields in the U. S., and it will be a great addition to our current geologic library in the U. S.",1
"At the end of Q4, we had record high future customer commitments of $293 million which is 4% higher than one year ago and a 13% increase from last quarter.",1
"We're in the process of connecting our Buckeye Texas assets to the new Cactus II Pipeline, as well as completing several facility debottlenecking projects underwritten by our customer to enhance our receipt and handling capabilities of increasing Permian Basin crude oil volumes.",1
"These vessels, more sophisticated specifications and greater capabilities, command higher day rates, which means each vessel has a greater financial impact on our overall fleet's results when it is idle for dry-docking or inspection due to the lost revenue, the potential mobilization cost to a shipyard, plus the actual cost of the inspection and any repairs.",0
"Repair and maintenance expense at about $36 million was up about $3.5 million quarter-over-quarter or was at least a couple of million dollars short of where we were projecting R&M costs at the time of our last earnings conference call, again, largely reflecting the timing of vessels in dry-dock.",-1
"Our fifth horizontal rig, another newbuild, is also under contract, and we expect to take delivery of it early next year at the latest.",0
"So in order to get to an adjusted number that better reflects our results from ongoing operations, you need to exclude the expenses I just discussed and also assume that the IPO shares have been outstanding from the beginning of the period.",0
"Consolidated EBITDA excludes restructuring-related professional services costs, but includes $1.2 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.1 million of vessel operating lease expense related to vessel leases rejected in connection with our plan of reorganization.",-1
This segment continues to benefit from its focus on more effective supply management while the team continues to execute on its mission of driving higher utilization across the Buckeye system.,1
Maintenance capital for the second quarter of 2016 was $29.9 million compared to $23.6 million for the second quarter of 2015 and return capital spend was $81.9 million for the second quarter.,0
"Cash flow from operations for the three months ended September 30 was about $10 million, and largely offset negative cash flow from operations reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.",1
"We also announced this morning an increase to our quarterly distribution of $0.0125, which brings our first quarter distribution up to $1.25 per limited partner unit.",1
"For example, IP rates from our Reagan County Core wells are coming around 10% lower than our Upton County core wells, and costs are lower by about the same factor.",0
"Since joining Buckeye in July, I've managed our Buckeye Services business unit, which is comprised of our Merchant Services and Development & Logistics segments and our Natural Gas Storage business, which is reflected as discontinued operations.",-1
"As a result, the stacked fleet during the September quarter averaged 44 vessels, and was at 51 vessels at September 30 or up 13 vessels quarter-over-quarter.",1
"First of all as you can see on slide four, we grew oil volumes 27% in one quarter, all through the drill bits.",1
"We are very proud of this accomplishment, considering 30 MBoe per day is up almost 40% from our Q3 2015 average.",1
"In our Domestic Pipes & Terminals segment, growth capital projects, including the benefit of diversification beyond refined products drove an almost $62 million improvement in 2013.",1
"So we feel like we have the wind at our back, realized prices are going up with an oilier mix, unit costs are coming down with greater scale, we're delivering strong Wolfcamp wells, we're just scratching the surface in the Southern Delaware, and we're looking forward to some promising appraisal activity in Midland Basin as well.",1
"For example, we used our highest day rate rig on our first well, which was also burdened by weather delays that contributed to an expensive mobilization from the Midland Basin.",-1
Earlier this morning we reported fully diluted earnings per share for our fiscal quarter of $0.65 which compared to $0.48 a year ago.,0
We have previously indicated that we would consider increasing the rate of distribution growth as cash flows ramped up from our advancing projects.,1
"Turning to slide 8, this is the first time we've put Midland and Delaware type curves together and I think it's instructive for a 7,000 stimulated for Delaware well, we're showing an 880 MBoe type curve provided by our reserve auditors.",0
"In fact, we plan to redraw our map to reflect our latest petro-physical analysis and results you can be on the look out for that in the near future.",0
Mid-30%s vessel level cash operating margin will continue to remain a near-term target recognizing that there'll be volatility in operating costs and vessel level cash operating margin on a quarter-to-quarter basis for the reasons just noted.,-1
"While it may be difficult to do so in today's environment, it's important to keep in perspective that the offshore industry remains an important segment for the global oil industry accounting for roughly one-third of the world's oil output.",-1
Reported capital expenditures decreased by $44 million quarter-over-quarter to $92 million driven by lower drilling and completion activity and also by declining well costs that yielded lower than estimated costs for prior-period wells.,-1
"During the quarter, we set a record for processing throughput volumes on both splitters, each averaging well above nameplate throughput capacity for the quarter.",1
"Utilization of active vessels in the Americas segment at approximately 86% was down about 3 percentage points quarter-over-quarter, was still relatively strong and stable in the December quarter.",1
"Equally as important, these results confirm the strength of the Tidewater franchise, something that shouldn't be overlooked as we enter a period of business uncertainty.",1
"Going back to the pipelines, the transportation volumes on the pipes came in at 3.3% higher than the prior year with strength in gasoline and distillates driving this increase.",1
The Chicago complex was created in 2010 as a result of combining a terminal acquisition with three existing Buckeye terminals.,0
The result was a program that look much different than the set of wells we expect to drill when we first issued guidance.,0
We also plan to transition to a more measured development phase in 2018 that prioritizes operational continuity and financial stability and takes another big step toward free cash flow generation.,1
"Average towing-supply and supply day rates at $14,300 a day were essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, though as Jeff will discuss in a moment, a continuing positive trend in working jackup rigs and recent vessel tender awards should help reduce any excess vessel capacity, which should ultimately lead to day rate improvements for our shallow water class of equipment.",1
We believe that our activity levels in Australia will pick up towards the end of fiscal 2014 or early in fiscal 2015.,1
"For our butane blending activities, while physical sales prices for gasoline declined significantly between the periods, our 2015 realized commodity margin did benefit significantly from the commodity hedging program as we hedged approximately two-thirds of our spring butane blending activity before the downturn in commodity prices.",-1
"Concerning expansion capital, we spent a record $703 million on organic growth construction projects during 2014 with the bulk of the spending for construction of the BridgeTex pipeline and expansion of the Longhorn system.",1
Also adjusted EBITDA includes $2.8 million and $1.5 million of pre-tax income from discontinued operations in 2012 and 2011 respectively from the sale of our Permian and North Dakota properties.,0
"These assumptions provide us confidence in our annual distribution growth target of 8% for 2017, while leaving us with a healthy 1.2 times coverage ratio and approximately $180 million of excess cash flow for the year.",1
"So, as you can tell, Magellan remains active in delivering growth for our investors by diligently placing our current growth projects into service and by exploring the best opportunities for us to satisfy the energy industry's growing infrastructure needs, which will most likely produce our next wave of growth opportunities.",1
You can see the performance of our horizontal Codell program which is performing right now better than our overall Niobrara program.,1
"As discussed, utilization in the March quarter reflects a relatively high dry-docking schedule, even after the deferral of a couple of dry docks.",0
"If these additional rigs are largely incremental to the working rig count, our towing-supply vessels should experience increased demand and presumably support higher day rates.",1
"Similar to last quarter, we still expect  (12:25) margins to be around $0.40 per gallon for the year, with around 80% of our fall blending hedged at this point.",0
"As usual, my comments will be high level for the quarter, so for a more complete analysis of our quarterly and year-to-date results, please refer to our press release and 10-Q that we filed this morning.",0
You may recall that we've indicated we believe the appropriate level of excess cash coverage is the point in time calculation based on the current operating environment and the impact that that environment may have on our distributable cash flow.,-1
"CapEx in the final quarter of fiscal 2014 is expected to be about $95 million, based upon commitments as of December 31.",0
Revenue increased $3.7 million mostly due to new contracts at our East Houston terminal and higher transportation revenue from our Houston distribution system.,1
"As scheduled, the rig has moved back to our Southern Utica acreage to drill two additional wells on the Garvin pad.",0
"Adjusting for these non-recurring costs, we would have reported a net income of approximately $3 million for the year ended 2012 and a net income of approximately $29 million for the year ended 2013.",0
"Most of our acreage is in liquid rich window where the bulk of our 2014 drilling we'll be targeting, 11 wells currently producing and our cost structure remains at about that $9 million per well.",0
We just announced that we've entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of Spectra Energy Partners to utilize an existing 160-mile pipeline for a portion of the route.,0
"We continue to focus on adding value for our shareholders, are in excellent position to execute our 2014 capital program and business plan, focusing on our liquid rich horizontal plays.",1
"While I wouldn't characterize tax expense as an unusual or special item, the unusual relationship between pre-tax earnings and tax expense contributed to a noisy quarter and was driven as much by non-operating items as well as by operating items.",0
"During this quarter, we continued to build on our strong safety performance and maintain our commitment to a best-in-class compliance program.",1
"If you look at our cash on hand of June 30, the forecasted cash flow and capital expenditures in the second half of 2014, we believe we'll exit the year with zero or very little draw on our revolver during the sale of our Marcellus joint venture interest which closes this year.",0
Adjusted cash flow from operations would be about $71.7 million or about $2 per basic share and a $1.75 per fully diluted share.,0
"Looking at the crude segment overall, total shipments declined due to fewer barrels shipped under our separate Houston distribution tariff structure.",-1
Our targeted liquidity range is therefore also reduced and is now $3.25 billion to $4.25 billion including our undrawn $3 billion revolving credit facility.,0
Customers are keenly focused on cost-cutting efforts and are searching for opportunities to further reduce their 2015 and 2016 spend.,-1
"We continue to make progress on these projects, which are still in the early stages of construction and make up the bulk of the future spending.",1
These results included $13 million or $0.04 per diluted share in net favorable items that are detailed in our press release.,1
"During the quarter we were awarded a contract in Brazil for the KG1 for three years at $440,000 per day and will be relocating the rig from India later this year.",0
"As the law is currently written, we are considered an obligated party under the Renewable Fuel Standard due to our butane blending activities.",0
"Even though this new pipeline has just started operations, I'm happy to report that it is already exceeding our expectations.",1
"We did a great job of not only meeting, but exceeding our internal targets and now expect to finish the year at the top end or slightly above our full year guidance of 15 million barrels of oil equivalent.",1
We expect this trend to continue and full year LOE to fall in comfortably within our guided range on the right hand side of the graph.,-1
"But as a result of the amended contract, it will not earn a dayrate during the first quarter of 2018.",0
Our adjusted net income of $12 million in the fourth quarter compares to a $400 million adjusted net loss for the same quarter of 2014.,-1
"For the full year, we had an adjusted net loss of $46.1 million compared to the $37.7 million adjusted net loss in the year 2014.",-1
"An extremely strong second quarter for the company, significantly beating our expectations giving us confidence for our positive 2016 re-guide today.",1
"Also of note, earlier this year we announced and discussed our intent to market certain non-strategic assets with targeted proceeds of $50 million to $75 million.",0
"While there's tremendous need to lower expenses associated with these projects, operators are steadfast in their expectation of superior operational and safety performance.",1
"First of all, the LDS and Cockroft pad shown on the top two charts continue to outperform their MRL 685,000 barrel of oil equivalent type curve by 30% plus.",1
"With our strong liquidity, industry-leading backlog, diversity, and excellent safety and operational track record, we are positioning Transocean to increase our market-leading position.",1
"Net income for the quarter was approximately $46 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $72 million in the first quarter of 2016.",-1
"And thinking about our expectations for cash and liquidity, the inclusion of the cash receipts from the sale will increase our total cash balance at the end of 2017 to be more in the range of a $100 million to $150 million with our leverage ratio remaining at an estimated 1.7 times.",1
"We have connected to our dock at Texas City but the connection to our primary customer has been delayed on their side due to their requirement to replace a short section, which is scheduled for the first half of December.",-1
"The day rate range is expected to be around $365,000 per day to $400,000 per day, although there have been relatively few new indicative data points.",0
"We believe we're well-positioned, given the current available capacity in our offshore oil pipelines and our Gulf Coast infrastructure to benefit in the latter part of this decade from the dramatically accelerating level of development activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.",1
"Construction activities are accelerating at our rail facility in Raceland, Louisiana, which is anticipated to be operational late this year.",-1
"Our 2014 annual effective tax rate from continuing operations is still expected within the range of our previous guidance of 14% to 17%, this expectation reflect our results for the quarter, and an updated forecast for each of our rigs.",1
"As always, we'd like to recognize the efforts and commitment of all of those with whom we're fortunate enough to work, including their commitments to providing safe, responsible and reliable services.",0
The decrease in expected 2015 O&M costs is partly due to scrapping of non-core assets and a material reduction in expenses associated with stacked floaters.,1
To the latter point we continue to optimize the cost of stacking ultra-deepwater rigs and have made significant progress in this regard.,1
We'd expect to reflect a one-time charge of potentially a couple of million or so in the second quarter reflecting the costs of these unfolding actions.,0
"We've seen the basis differentials expand a bit recently, and it's important to point out that we do have basis swaps in place for approximately 55% to 60% of this expected gas production at approximately $0.45 per MMBtu.",0
We project a three-year production compounding growth rate of about 33% with approximately 25% growth at the midpoint for 2018 and approximately 35% growth at the midpoint for 2019.,1
"To mitigate this ongoing challenge, we at Transocean will continue with the approach of managing those things within our control.",0
"Turning to Mexico, they had a very encouraging turnout for Round 1.4, and we are encouraged for the possibility for a 2018 drilling campaign, particularly with BHP with their 60% ownership of the producing Trion block.",1
"And as a reminder to all of our call participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question.",1
"Penn Virginia is very fortunate and well positioned, so that now the entirety of our oil production is sold into the LLS market, which is currently trading at a significant premium to WTI.",1
"We have a multi-year inventory of drilling locations with robust economics, especially with a growing inventory of XRLs in Area 2, as well as in Area 1 and the future potential that EOR may have for Penn Virginia.",0
"In our G&P segment, we had a solid quarter with continued record volumes and strong cash flows in the DJ coupled with increasing volumes out of the Eagle Ford.",1
DCP continues to successfully execute its financial plan ending the quarter with a strong bank leverage ratio of 3.8 times and distribution coverage of 1.1 times.,1
"And lastly, our second quarter DCF of $68 million is in line with our full year forecast, and we are on track to achieve our 6% to 8% distribution growth target in 2013.",1
"At the Cinco Ranch LTD Unit #1H, 2,611 barrels of oil equivalent per day over 32 frac stages; the Bock #6H, 2,272 barrels of oil equivalent per day over 26 frac stages; the Amber 1H, 2,217 barrels of oil equivalent per day over 23 frac stages; the Amber 2H, 1,919 barrels of oil equivalent per day over 22 frac stages; and the Wombat #1H, 1,670 barrels of oil equivalent per day over 20 frac stages.",0
"In the second quarter, four of our Shiner wells on two-pads experienced these challenges resulting in material delays in what was originally planned for 133 stages among these four well, resulted in only 94 stages, once again a 29% reduction.",-1
"Quarter-after-quarter since this cycle unfolded, the DCP enterprise has outperformed itself in resetting our business to be sustainable in any environment.",1
"Southern Hills volumes were also up compared to the third quarter of last year, due to increased NGL production from DCP Midstream's National Helium plant, which restarted in the fourth quarter of 2015.",1
"That said, the older, lower spec units are fully capable to drill in most markets and we expect that an improving market for ultra-deepwater assets will provide ample opportunities in the future.",1
The only place where we would have an annualized number is with our reported leverage where we are allowed to take into account pro forma adjusted EBITDAX per our credit facility for a trailing 12-month period.,0
She will be picking up the Investor Relations role where Jonni Anwar left off as he moves on to another role in DPM.,1
"The graph at the bottom of the slide shows the sensitivity for our $4.8 million well, with the top or green line.",0
"We've bought down our total company LOE over the last couple of years by approximately 25%, mostly by divesting at higher cost areas and improving efficiency.",-1
"Overall, our NGL pipeline adds some strength and diversity of our portfolio and they provide us with upside potential from ethane recovery.",1
"Prior to getting started, I'd like to remind you of the language in our forward-looking statements section of the press release, which was released yesterday afternoon.",0
This assumes that we perform in the second half of the year at the same levels as we did in June and July.,0
"While the pace of tendering for ultra-deepwater and deepwater rigs accelerated greatly in the second quarter, contract awards continue to take a long time to reach closure mainly due to regulatory requirements and in some cases delays of projects due to economic viability.",-1
"We saw many of you just a month ago at our Investor Day where our management team shared with you our philosophy for operating the DCP enterprise, and how our unmatched footprint and our growth-for-growth strategy have created a flywheel of organic growth opportunities at the Partnership.",1
Our leverage at year-end was 3.7 times total debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDAX compared to our credit facility covenant of 4.5 times.,0
"These margins do not benefit from any of the asset or other impairment charges recorded this quarter, as these impairments were accounted as of December 31.",0
Wholesale Propane adjusted segment EBITDA of $13 million was lower than last year by $9 million and included a $3 million unfavorable lower cost for market adjustment during the quarter.,-1
The combined savings from the slightly reduced risk program and the location cleanup exercise will yield $500 million in pre-tax annualized savings.,0
"First slide, I'm going to address little later our production variance in the fourth quarter as compared to guidance, but we have some significant accomplishments during the year that we think will provide longer term benefits to this company.",1
Our objectives are clear and I'm very pleased with the tangible progress and the hard work to achieve our ETR reduction goals.,1
"We have a positive outlook for our business in the second half, with improved activity in China and Australia and growth in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.",1
"So turning to slide 14, we believe we have a very high growth rate for 2018 compared to that of our peers.",1
"Today you'll hear from Wouter van Kempen, Chairman, President and CEO of both DCP Midstream and the Partnership; and Sean O'Brien, CFO of both companies.",0
"Looking to 2016, we will continue to execute and reduce earnings volatility with fee-based margins forecasted to grow to 65% and a 2016 fee based and hedged margin of about 80%.",-1
The amendments allow a higher amount of restructuring charges to be added to EBITDA when calculating the covenants and allow excluding certain collateralized letters of credit from the specified debt.,-1
"During the first quarter, we signed an agreement with Schlumberger to create OneStim, a joint venture focused on Completion products and services for the development of unconventional resource plays in the United States and Canada land markets.",0
"The Kudu 1H, Kudu 2H, Kudu 3H, Kudu 4H, and Kudu 5H were drilled in 2011, 2012 and 2015, so there has been nearby offset production in the unit for several years, yet even with accurate production in the unit for over five years, production appears to be in line with expectations and is still cleaning up.",1
"And as we continue on this high growth trajectory, DPM as a standalone is well on its way to becoming one of the largest G&P and NGL producing MLPs.",1
"As we announced last week, the Texas Express Pipeline operated by Enterprise and on 10% by DPM, has been placed into service.",0
The combined savings from the now-concluded RIF program and the location cleanup exercise will yield $500 million in pre-tax annualized savings going forward.,0
The only items going forward will be any residual charges for the Iraq EPF contract and certain legal and divestiture costs along with gains and losses on the divestiture of our non-core businesses.,-1
"Our last remaining EPF project in Iraq, Zubair, is 90% complete and is currently scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2015.",0
"The final structure that I'd like to catch on is Baird Whitehead's retirement, which was erroneously reported by the Philadelphia Inquirer as an ""abrupt departure"".",-1
"For the third quarter of 2015, spud to TD averaged 8.67 days for an average lateral length of 4,930 feet, and an average measured depth of 16,128 feet.",0
"In the South, adjusting for Harvey impact, Q3 volumes would have been slightly above Q2, showing continued production growth in the Eagle Ford.",1
The 2018 percentage of fee versus commodity margin will be updated when we roll out our 2018 guidance and commodity sensitivities.,0
Keathley Canyon is supported by life of lease agreements with minimum throughput commitment and is already filling up very quickly.,1
"And that's primarily driven by Keathley Canyon going into service; the O'Connor Plant in our DJ Basin system, which is running virtually full; and DPM's acquisition of an additional 20% ownership of the Eagle Ford system last year.",0
"With that, I'd like to thank you for your interest in the Partnership and Sean and I are now available to take your questions.",0
"Although we anticipate growing a 100% year-over-year, we are expecting to be cash flow neutral in the fourth quarter of 2018, and Penn Virginia is committed to maintaining a solid balance sheet with ample liquidity.",0
"And at this time, I'd like to turn the phone call over to John Brooks, so he can give you some additional operational detail for the first quarter.",0
"In the third quarter of 2016, we guided to $16 million to $19 million for G&A, but that included the capitalized portion.",0
"As Tim just mentioned, we will acquire Phillips 66's interest in the Bayou Bridge Project, which will deliver crude oil from the Phillips 66 and Sunoco Logistics Partners terminals in Nederland, Texas to Lake Charles, Louisiana and then on to St.",-1
"Before I get started, I want to point out that unless otherwise noted, all numbers that are referenced today will be for the period following the close of the IPO that occurred on July 26 through September 30.",0
"The Bayou Bridge Pipeline in which we have a 40% interest currently operates from the Phillips 66 Beaumont Terminal to Lake Charles, Louisiana.",-1
"The 2014 objectives of $1.10 to $1.20 in earnings, free cash flow of $0.5 billion, and net debt reduction in excess of $1 billion, are reasonable and grounded on careful assessment.",0
We did place nine new Wolfcamp B wells on production with an average peak of 24-hour IP rate of over 900 barrels of oil equivalent per day.,0
"First I'm going to touch on, on Slide 11, the recent well results in the Southern Wolfcamp joint interest area.",0
"Total costTotal cost, if you look at a 7,000 foot lateral that puts the total well cost back to about $7 million or less.",0
"Turning to slide 19 to look at production costs, you can see we‚Äôre very consistent with both the first quarter and the fourth quarter.",0
"Of course, the largest single market opportunity will continue to be in the United States, specifically in West Texas and Oklahoma.",1
Automated controls for inventory management are in place in many regions and will be implemented in all regions by year end.,0
We are working on the last two wells of the only remaining turnkey project in Iraq and expect to substantially complete them before the end of the year.,0
"(29:41) The other items were all within guidance other than for G&A that was higher primarily due to increase in stock base compensation expense as a result of the company's stock price performance and then when you look at current income taxes, we just benefit during the quarter from capitalizing IDC important and originally planned which had the effect of reducing previously recorded AMT and Texas margin tax estimate.",0
In the denominator we add the same total debt number to the equity number to get the total capitalization number.,0
"We continue to focus on becoming a more diversified midstream company, with our sights set on a more balanced portfolio that will create long-term value for our shareholders.",0
"In the European, Caspian, Russian, SSA region, revenue was down 24%, reflecting sharp seasonal winter declines in Russia and North Sea, coupled with project cancellations across SSA.",-1
"I think it will be into the second quarter before we have wells producing enough days given the fact they should exhibit some more production trajectories that I showed you on the slide 17, Lower Spraberry Shale-type curves.",0
"In the very, very agile  line  (1:32:13) in the north to south in the Eagle Ford, how many wells do you actually expect top put on production in each of those  just knows that it was (1:32:19) a spud count that you provided.",0
"However, the decline in volume was more than offset by higher NGL and natural gas prices as compared to the prior quarter.",-1
"We're expanding our ownership in one of our gathering systems that will enable us to capture additional growth in the Wapiti area, which reaches out into Northwestern Alberta into the Montney shale development region.",1
All of our barrels are priced off of Cushing or LLS as we move barrels down to the Gulf Coast.,-1
The addition of natural gas inlet volumes at Badlands contributed to the overall increase while three target systems had significant year-over-year increases.,1
We all ‚Äì I mentioned earlier to add more rates by July 1 in response to reduced cost and improved price environment.,1
"In the fourth quarter, we were up 3% principally related LOE, which is the timing of invoices that was offset some by the decline in commodity prices reducing production taxes.",0
"Year-over-year, we saw an increase in volumes in WestTX, SAOU, SouthTX and Badlands, offset by lower volumes in WestOK, North Texas and Sand Hills, with volumes approximately flat in Versado and SouthOK.",1
"We believe that there will be continued asset rationalization in the Eagle Ford and that our multi-plant, multi-location footprint will benefit Targa as we have flexibility related to outlets' delivery points and reliability that are attractive to the producers.",1
"Targa's reported adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $328 million, which was 10% higher than the same period in 2016.",0
"At the same time, we didn't complete very many wells in the South in the fourth quarter and caught up in the first quarter.",-1
"You can see here on the slide, we've enumerated about $720 million of expenditures on drilling and infrastructure, that was a lot of Q4 costs that weren't invoiced until Q1.",0
"I think that's a pretty simple question because if you take a look at where we are in the Permian today, we are at 10 rigs.",0
"And for our current estimate of equity volumes from Field Gathering & Processing, we estimate we have now hedged approximately 70% of the remaining 2015 natural gas, approximately 60% of the remaining 2015 condensate, and approximately 30% of remaining NGL volumes.",0
"Our liquidity position still is excellent, with not only the cash on hand but 1.5 billion unsecured credit facility that is completely undrawn.",1
"If you look at our oil price differential for the quarter, it was down $1.20 from where we were in the first quarter.",0
We have lived more gathering lines and added more compression in 2017 than originally expected as the result of producer volume growth.,1
I'm also incredibly proud of the focus of our employees to deliver savings and operational results without sacrificing safety or environmental compliance and without saving today at the expense of tomorrow.,1
"In our Gathering and Processing segment, our 200 million cubic feet a day Buffalo plant in WestTX is also in the final stages of startup, providing much needed processing capacity and increasing system reliability and operational flexibility.",0
"For the remainder of the year and beyond, increasing G&P volumes are expected to result in increasing Y-grade volumes available for fractionation.",0
"Crude oil gathered increased to 101,000 barrels per day in the first quarter, a 35% increase versus the same time period last year as a result of producer activities.",1
"And we're mixing in a higher percentage of Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal wells that averaged about $2.23 per quarter ‚Äì $2.23 per BOE for the quarter, and they reduced our overall cost to about $6.19.",0
But we're also nickel and diming away other cost of these wells to try to get that money back including changing out surfactants and other things to try to reduce costs and reduce days.,-1
"For example, all the wells we've drilled this year, the oil content in those wells continue to average 70% to 80% that's what you expect, that's what we have seen through time in the field.",0
"Turning to the segment level, I'll summarize the first quarter's performance on a year-over-year basis and we'll start with our Gathering and Processing segments.",0
"The last three cargoes interestingly have gone through various areas of the world, including South Korea and Japan as well as into Wales.",-1
"We did put our -- put the number of wells planned on production, our POPs were 61 during the quarter.",0
"As a result of the prior couple of slides, our 10-year vision remains very much intact, to produce that 1 million barrels plus really within the next nine years or so, and it reflects really organic growth.",1
"For the non-fee-based operating margin, relative to the Partnership's current equity volumes from Field G&P, we estimate that we have hedged approximately 70% of 2014 natural gas and approximately 20% of 2014 combined NGL and condensate.",0
And that's what all of our employees are focused on as we embark upon the next nine years in this 10-year plan.,0
Much of our 2018 seismic work as well as well science and pad construction was also planned for the first half.,0
"We're going to be putting in place pipes that my Board hasn't approved yet, maybe plants that my Board hasn't approved yet, because there is so much going on there; and we'll talk about that in a little bit.",0
"So some temporary, perhaps less in utilization, and my longer term forecast would be need for additional fractionation over time.",0
I would like to briefly provide some color on our current expectations for the earn out payments related to our Permian acquisition that closed March 1.,-1
"Looking forward, we will likely need additional infrastructure in the Permian in 2019 and beyond to support the expected activity on acreage dedicated to our system.",0
"As Joe Bob mentioned earlier, the increasing domestic volume growth outlook is also likely to accelerate the need for additional fractionation space at Mont Belvieu and we could have growth CapEx spending for Train 6 in 2018 depending on expected volumes.",1
"Clearly, we're making steady progress on the profitable rebalancing of our E&P asset portfolio and production mix is bearing fruit in the form of steady EBITDA growth.",1
"At the close, the estimated net production from the assets was just over 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, which is about 66% crude oil.",0
"Before we open up the line to questions, I would just like to thank the Targa team again for another successful year in 2014.",0
"Capital expenditures on an accrual basis in the second quarter were $366 million, of which $245 million was directed to the Permian Basin; $70 million to the Williston Basin; and $49 million to the Haynesville.",0
The producer activity in this portion of the Permian Basin is very high and the activity around all our other Permian Basin systems continues to increase.,1
Our EBITDA from that side of the business more than doubled and it continues to be a real driver of growth.,1
"We exited the year with strong operational momentum driven by some very encouraging results from new completion designs in several of our key plays, a very strong balance sheet and access to plenty of liquidity.",1
"If we take those same numbers and simply reduce the maintenance CapEx by down to $12 million, the distribution coverage should be 1.6 times.",-1
"During the past quarter, we completed two equity offerings, selling approximately 14.5 million units for net proceeds of approximately $415 million.",0
"Four of the new wells are on a pad that's located in the northwest corner of our Fort Berthold acreage block and all four of them came on with excellent rates with an average 24-hour IP of over 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day gross processing.",1
"An additional five wells were completed on the second pod of the 10-well Independence Pad, which is located about 4 miles to the east and the average per well initial 24-hour rate for this group of wells was a little over 2,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day, post processing.",0
"Oil volumes were 4.9 million barrels, up 400,000 barrels; NGL volumes were 1.2 million barrels, up 250,000 barrels; and natural gas volumes were 44.5 Bcf, up 1.9 Bcf from their respective first quarter volumes.",1
"We are attempting to provide our investors and analysts, as well as the entire market, with the best information we have available.",0
"Late in the first quarter, Field Services commenced construction on a new project to add capacity through debottlenecking our Vermillion gas processing plant, which is located in southwest Wyoming.",0
"While there was some noise in the Field Services reported results this quarter, our outlook for the business is essentially unchanged.",0
"This brings the total number of units we have repurchased to about 3.7 million units, which are to offset the dilution of the 4.4 million warrants we issued to Oak Tree, of which 2.9 million have not yet vested.",0
"As that divergence would indicate, we expect an increase in estimated ultimate recovery for these new wells or the new completion design, but obviously, it won't be proportional to the large, i.e. 85%, improvement that we've seen in the early life performance.",1
"However, the recent decline in prices has provided additional opportunities for our storage and logistics business and we will continue to take advantage of that market, whenever it is available.",1
"Moving to our balance sheet, our debt outstanding was $2.2 billion, excluding $656 million under our working capital facility, which is fully secured by receivables and inventory.",1
"As you saw on our release yesterday, we delivered very impressive results during the quarter, completing and turning to sales nine gross operated wells in the Permian, and 15 gross operated wells in the Williston Basin.",1
"As we anticipated, our crude oil production volumes began to accelerate during the quarter, with crude oil production during the month of March averaging 55,500 barrels per day, setting a stage for the continued ramp into the second quarter and the rest of the year.",1
"And with what's in the pipeline, we can see our way easily to 700,000 next quarter, and possibly 800,000 barrels a day by the end of the year.",1
"In the subservice, we believe tank-style development optimizes stimulated rock volume, which should maximize the recovery of hydrocarbons and placing the target horizons while minimizing frac interference with offset producing and actively drilling wells.",-1
"Remember, we have a lot of science to do to evaluate the horizontal potential on some of the target intervals within the Wolfcamp and  Spraberry interval.",0
"A well-supplied and liquid LNG shipping market is important for us and our customers, and that's exactly what we have today.",0
We answer the question about oil in place by conducting detailed core analysis and then tying that core analysis to log data from vertical well control we have across the basin and across our specific assets.,0
Growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA is driven by our continued transition into operations at our Sabine Pass Liquefaction project.,1
"SG&A expense decreased by approximately 37% in fourth quarter 2016, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 and decreased 28% for full year 2016 as compared to prior year.",1
The first quarter saw record pipeline close in LNG production numbers as Trains 1 and 2 were in operation the entire quarter and Train 3 commissioning was successfully completed.,1
"That brings a total number of destination countries for Sabine Pass cargoes to 20, an increase of 6 from the end of the year.",1
"One of the best measures of that performance is direct operating expense and compared to the prior year quarter, our direct operating expenses on a per unit basis are down 15%.",1
Mexico's pull for U. S. LNG has remained robust and is likely to stay that way until the end of the year at least.,0
The industry has continually misjudged demands to the downside and we continue to see strong signals that the global LNG market will be more balanced over the coming years than it will be long.,-1
"These transactions are important not only for the margin they lock in, but also in furthering our long-term contracting efforts as we often sell cargoes in the short term to counterparties with long-term LNG supply needs.",0
"As discussed in our earnings release and just now by Jeff in his comments, we are well positioned for several years to move all of our gas and liquids.",0
"GAAP net income for all of 2013 totaled $116 million, a nine-fold increase from the 2012 net income figure of $13 million, and all of our non-GAAP measures are full reconciled to GAAP on the supplemental tables posted to the Investor Relations section of our website.",1
"With regards to the results of the first three months, Enag√°s finds itself on the right path to achieve the goals set for 2015.",1
"Thanks to the extraordinary efforts from many members of our team and the MarkWest team, we were still able to exceed production guidance for the quarter.",1
"With regards to the investment, we've invested a total of ‚Ç¨202 million, mainly at the Trans Adriatic Pipeline gas duct, which represents almost ‚Ç¨85 million, ‚Ç¨84.8 million and something that you already know, this is the cash output for the payment of the GSP guarantees amounting ‚Ç¨213 million.",0
"In addition, we posted on our website supplemental tables which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margin, and reconciliation of reported earnings to our adjusted non-GAAP earnings that are discussed on the call today.",0
"Given the large capital cuts from a large number of companies in our industry, which is resulting in a rapidly declining rig count and deferred completions.",-1
"And lastly, we think, because it is our objective, that our industry companies start contributing 13% of our net profit in 2017 compared to the 10% that they brought in 2016, and they will rise up to 25% in 2020 which reaffirms our established targets.",1
"These efforts have been recognized by Standard & Poor's and Fitch, which have both confirmed their ratings and have upgraded their long-term outlook from negative to stable.",1
"Natural gas continues to take market share from coal, and I believe that this trend will continue given that natural gas is a much friendlier fuel from an environmental perspective than coal.",0
"In the dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania, we had a two-well pad come online with an average initial rate to sales of 34.2 million a day per well under constraint conditions.",0
"Therefore, we see an advantage with our capital efficiency increasing steadily in the future as we go forward with longer and longer laterals.",1
The average and initial sales rate of the five wells was 18 million cubic feet equivalent per day under constraint conditions and had 120-day average of 8.5 million a day.,0
This great improvement will start to show in 2015 and we expect the system to post a surplus for the first time in the last few years.,1
"The two clearest paths for this are expansions of the Ohio Valley Connector and the Mountain Valley Pipeline, which will offer more access to the Midwest and Southeast markets.",0
This is a 23% improvement over the second quarter of last year with the same number of frac crews as we had last year.,1
"Earlier this month, we did add a new partner to the project, RGC Resources, the parent company of Roanoke Gas Company.",0
"I had previously spent time with Colonial Pipeline, Buckeye Partners, and JP Energy and various roles from field operations to executive leadership.",0
"Another expense item impacted by nonrecurring activity was transportation, gathering and compression expense which at $0.96 was $0.08 below guidance.",1
"Continuing with what was reported during our first quarter conference call, the drilling team continues to drill longer laterals this year and has drilled seven of the top ten longest laterals, since inception of the seven laterals, four were drilled in the second quarter, averaging over 14,000 feet.",0
"Shifting to North Louisiana, our plan for the year remains consistent focusing on Terryville, while methodically testing and delineating the extension areas over time.",1
"In January, we did utilize our revolving credit facility to make the $110 million cash payment to EQT for the deferred consideration portion of the Sunrise acquisition.",0
"The first 75 billion BTU per day will be in service on April 1, with the remaining capacity to be completed and in service by midyear 2015.",0
"Starting the top left portion of the page, low pressure gathering volumes were 1.6 Bcf per day in the second quarter, which represents an 11% increase from the prior year quarter.",1
"Jeff highlighted some very impressive dry gas well results, which give us confirmation as a potential reserves for the 235,000 dry gas acres that we have in Southwest PA.",1
"If natural gases priced at roughly $3 given all the uplifts from the natural gas liquids and condensate, the effective price we receive in the wet gas portion of the Marcellus is about $6 or about double gas price alone.",1
"These attributes, combined with AR's strong operating performance and backlog of ready-to-complete wells, gives us comfort in providing 2016 preliminary targets and, in turn, visibility for AM unitholders.",1
"One of the key highlights from AR's mid-year reserve evaluation was the upgrade of about 600 proved undeveloped and probable drilling locations from a 1.7 Bcf per 1,000 EUR type curve to an approximate 2.0 Bcf per 1,000 EUR type curve.",0
"The growth is mostly driven by our approximately 1,000,000 net acre land position in Pennsylvania, specifically by low-risk, high-return drilling in the Marcellus shale.",1
"And how we ramp that up with infrastructure so we keep our transportation cost down and our compression cost down and we fill up the plant at the right level, at the right timing and with HBP acreage all at the same time.",-1
"Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Partnership, which reflects contribution from the Water Handling and Treatment segment only during the fourth quarter 2015 and corresponds to our previous guidance of $180 million to $190 million was $215 million.",0
"It's also worth mentioning that when you incorporate the hedge book in order to arrive at blended gas and NGL price, these rates of returns increased dramatically to a range of mid-40% to 80%.",1
AR reported another strong quarter producing a record 1.875 Bcf equivalent per day which represents a year-over-year increase of 25% and drove the strong volume metric throughput growth at AM.,1
"The Marcellus has continued to surprise us to the high side in terms of productivity and efficiency gains, as evidenced by the consistent reserve growth and production results over the last decade with improved type curves over time, most recently in the super-rich area that has continued to outperform our expectations.",1
"Moving up into the right, the red diamonds represent wells completed with 1,500 pounds per foot of proppant and 34 barrels per foot of water, essentially the recipe that we used in 2016.",1
"Compression volumes eclipsed the 1 Bcf a day mark for the first time in Antero Midstream history, which is a testament to the growth and operational success in the field we have achieved since the AM IPO.",1
"As you may have read, the IRS lifted its moratorium on issuing private letter rulings, or PLRs, on March 6 of this year.",0
"As a reminder, all of AR's acreage in the Utica is dedicated to AM, so the incremental production from the aforementioned wells will flow into AM-owned and operated low and high pressure gathering lines.",0
"On our Delaware Basin asset of approximately 20,000 gross net acres, we're equally focused and optimistic about our ability to increase our Delaware leasehold position in 2017 as well.",1

This is another key step in the build out of our LNG network and positions UGI as a leader in LNG peaking services.,1
"This was evidenced by our Land Department's continued progress towards increasing our net mineral ownership on a platform in areas where we don't have a 100% lease, as well as pursue new leases in designated areas of interest in both our Permian and core areas.",1
UGI and AmeriGas undertake no obligations to release revisions to their forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after today.,0
We're very pleased with our progress over the first 60 days and look forward to providing information on the positive impact of this new business when we provide our fiscal year 2016 guidance.,1

"Similarly, gas ‚Äì the gas received price reduced by 52% on a ‚Äì production costs, per BOE for the three months ended March 31, 2015 increased to $13.30 per BOE as compared to $11.79 in 2014.",1
"On a per BOE basis, this equates to a drop from $11.72, that's $11.72, in 2014 to $10.44 in 2015 for the three-month period, and from $14.68 in 2014 to $10.76 in 2015 for the year.",0
"Our first Mississippian  dual coplanar (17:21) extended lateral, the Dettle 1-29 20H, produced a 30-day IP of 1,100 BOE per day comprised of 60% oil for $1.7 million per lateral and projects an IRR of 32%.",1
"Currently, we have approximately $100 million in cash and $425 million less any outstanding letters of credit available to draw under our credit facility, giving us readily available liquidity of approximately $525 million.",1
"An example of the impact of Fresh Start is that our oil and gas assets will be recorded at fair market value as of the emergence of the state using strip pricing, whereas we apply our impairment test against SEC pricing.",-1
"At the Utility, the weather was also about the same as in fiscal year 2012 and earnings are higher this year in spite of significant growth in capital expenditures over the time period.",1
"Although we generally paused acquisition activity during the year as we completed the Heritage integration, our corporate development team is now actively sourcing new deals as we take advantage of the increased footprint and synergy opportunities resulting from the Heritage acquisition.",1

We were pleased to see the improved volumes in April and May due to the cooler weather in these shoulder months.,1
The payoff of the building note was necessary to facilitate the planned sell of one of our downtown corporate properties that served as partial collateral for our increasing rate note.,0
We have also moved decisively to improve margins while continuing to create asset value growth as shown with the increased net present value of proved reserves.,1
Combining these initiatives for improvement and change with the strong financial position and operational capabilities will result in a company that is compelling to a broad base of existing and potential new investors.,1
"At the end of December, the French parliament approved a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 34.4% to 28.9% beginning in 2020.",1
"Because our French operations have deferred tax liabilities that are expected to be paid after the new rates become effective, we reduced our net deferred tax liabilities by $24.7 million.",1
The favorable average unit margin impact was primarily due to exiting the lower margin auto gas business in Poland partially offset by lower average cylinder and bulk unit margins due to rising LPG cost in the quarter compared to declining LPG cost in the prior period.,-1
"But in fact, because of our focus on multiple fronts and successive 90-day plans, we've achieved all that and we're not finished for the year.",1
Our teams continue to deliver above expectations with their highly efficient drilling program and cost reduction achievements on our existing asset base.,1
"Finally, we've implemented a more proactive chemical management program which led to $2 million savings compared to the first three quarters of last year.",1

We have a $40 million land budget this year primarily for our Mid-Continent assets as well as finalizing our 3D shoots in the North Park Basin.,0
"Next, we achieved a record $3.4 million for lateral drilling and completion cost with our Castle 1-17H 20 extended lateral that's in the D bench.",1
"Total revenue has also declined, as expected, due to the expiration of higher price legacy contracts, which drove ARLP's average price realization in the 2017 quarter down 9.1% to $45.12 per ton sold compared to the 2016 quarter.",-1
"While still early in the program and determining the best prototype well configuration for a given geological setting, we're seeing the benefits of this capital efficiency initiative.",1
"As we outlined at Analyst Day, we have developed a new geologic model and this latest well has achieved the expected result, delivering a 30-day IP of 360 Boe per day at 84% oil.",1
"A couple of unusual items this quarter, first we reported $38 million in impairment on unproved properties related to our Haynesville Shale assets.",-1
Our experience has been that there is sufficient interruptible space available and we've had no trouble moving all the volume we produce on any given day.,-1
The impact of our response to current market conditions is reflected in ARLP's 2016 guidance that Brian will discuss in a few minutes.,0
"When it is clear that project or asset will no longer compete within our portfolio, we look to monetize it and redirect the proceeds to higher return projects or to enhance our balance sheet.",1
"Over the near term, we continue to believe that the U. S. supply, demand picture will continue to slowly improve, but tepid power demand and a weak outlook for exports will dampen the potential for meaningful price recovery through the end of 2013.",-1
"In East Texas our focus for 2014 is to roughly determine the economic potential of the acreage we've amassed there, start the build out of gathering infrastructures to the most prospective portions of the prospect areas and determine where we would like to pursue additional leasing.",0
On slide 18 then you can see the impact to the economics of this program with rates of return improving an incremental 25 percentage points and net present values improving by an incremental $2 million per well.,1
We have the potential to add a significant amount of really valuable oily inventory in a core area of the company.,1
"In the current market, we think those two characteristics should be even more important to investors, and SM Energy is a name that we believe investors should want to own going forward.",0
"Switching to the balance sheet on slide 7, we remain in the top tier of our peers in terms of debt to EBITDAX at 1.9 times as of the end of the third quarter.",0
"And looking ahead to 2017, we have a plan that stays below four times as well assuming oil prices average $45 and natural gas $2.75.",0

"This is a great asset with a lot of hydrocarbon in place, well over 6 billion equivalent on our 161,000 operated acres and many years of growth potential from a large inventory of future drilling location.",1
Strong production has slightly higher oil percentage in the mix reflects the timely and successful re-initiation of drilling and completion efforts in the Permian Basin.,1
"That borrowing base is currently about $1.2 billion, with the divestitures I certainly anticipated declining somewhat here in the short-term, but I also don't anticipate us needing to draw on it either outside of some strategic purpose.",-1
"Putting together what we've learned from our 2015 and 2016 pilot programs, as well as looking at offset operator data, the 2017 drilling program will include longer lateral averaging about well over 8,500 feet.",0
"For the last four quarters, we've continued to communicate to our investors the strategic rationale behind the decision that we made earlier this year to hold our distributions flat so that we could allow our assets in these investments the time to catch up on the growth cycle to the point of generating substantial cash returns on the capital that we have invested.",1
"As a result, we're going to be spending very little capital in the fourth quarter and we will wait until we have gotten more detail from Antero about their full-year 2015 plans.",0
"Now, Herb is going to give you more details on those results in a couple of minutes, and I think they're very impressive.",1
"I should add that we measure key performance indicators at each field operation, so we were able to assess where we're leading and where we're lagging and we're able to continuously improve our operation in terms of production and costs.",1

"Basis spreads, as you know, in that area reached as high as $3.50 a dekatherm in the last month, averaging over a $1 a decatherm across the North-South system over the last couple of quarters, and it continues to drive strong demand for both our firm and our interruptible wheeling and hub services for Marcellus Shale production in that part of the world.",1
"Over the last past year, condensate prices have increased over $12 per barrel and NGL prices have increased over $2 a barrel.",1
"Also, I'd like to point out that many of the comments during this teleconference are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties affecting outcomes, many of which are beyond our control and are discussed in more detail in the Risk Factors the Forward-Looking Statements sections of our annual and quarterly filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",0

The excess amount borrowed over the new borrowing base is required to be repaid in three installments over 90 days.,0
"Now you can pick your one, but if you believe this Draconian Street re-contracting assumption, quote the bear case, it's pretty simple, which one do you think is going to go in half?",0
"The increase in cash flows in 2017 was primarily due to higher realized prices, lower operating expenses and lower interest payments.",1
"Our plan is to drill six Pronghorn sand wells per 1,280 acre spacing unit which is up from our initial plan of three wells per spacing unit.",1
"Finally, the second of two upstream pipelines that deliver barrels to Pony Express activated their contracts in May, allowing PXP to begin to collect its joint tariff fees from those shippers.",0
"Nevertheless, we feel confident that our low leverage and other factors that are healthy within TEP provide us ample debt flexibility.",1
"On slide number 12, our second quarter EBITDA margin continued to be strong at 67% of our blended realized price per BOE.",1
There are some refinements in the flooding mechanism in terms of how much water and how much CO2 we're putting into the ground.,0
"Early on, of course, I would say and probably overall philosophically, we're delivering in the lower cost of the pipeline.",0
"Well, what we can say there on the east side is that we have ‚Äì in additional to our Middle Bakken program, we've got a Three Forks program going out there and the Three Forks has been very successful along the western half of the field.",1
"And so, the lower number that you just mentioned would apply generally to the 640-acre shorter laterals and the 5,000-foot laterals.",0
I guess I would remind you that incremental shipments are similar to walk-up barrels in that when we ship them they are earned revenue in current period cash flow.,1
"Meanwhile, as of December 31, 2013, our combined company will have more than 600 million BOEs of proved reserves and 1.2 billion BOEs of 3P reserves, 80% of which is in the Bakken Three Forks.",0
"As you can see from the slide, we control the sweet spots of the central eastern and southern Williston Basin where the wells have cumulative production in the first 90 days of more than 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent as denoted on the slide by the larger back dots on the Whiting acreage.",0
"As you may recall, last quarter, we disclosed that TEP had issued on its ATM and subsequently in July, purchased from TDev and retired approximately 3.6 million units.",-1
"In aggregate, TEP has now generated a total of $22.8 million of proceeds through equity sales at prices in excess of the $42.50 strike price of the call option unit and this has reduced TEP's debt, and effectively lowered the purchase price for the third Pony Express dropdown.",0
We are however in the process of determining whether or not to construct the necessary facilities at our Buckingham terminal in order to accept condensate barrels on a walkup basis and provide additional optionality for our existing and future customers.,0
"In summary, our plan going forward is to operate within cash flow, have property sales of $20 per barrel LOE properties, and drill new properties with LOE of half that for margin improvement; then growing production and reserves from the lower base by getting 40% to 50% increases in the first 12 months production, with well costs only 15% higher.",1
Driving our performance was our enhanced completion designs in the Williston Basin that delivered 22% production increases quarter-over-quarter on a per well basis.,1
"We control the sweet spots of the Williston Basin, and have continued to increase productivity within the basin with new completion technology.",1
"As a reminder, Pony Express has contracted at just over 300,000 barrels per day, and we continue to collect monthly payments based on contracted, but not throughput volumes.",0
"Shifting to Gathering and Processing, for our crude oil gathering, we expect slight growth in volumes on our legacy assets in 2017, driven by the new inbound gathering interconnection we completed during the fourth quarter and planned well completions in our Bakken footprint.",1
We are on track to achieve well over our 2020 target of $110 million of net earnings or $200 million of EBITDA from our business in the Permian.,1
"With the focus on the Bakken and the Niobrara, as you can see in slide number 4, total net production was 134,245 BOEs per day in the second quarter.",0
Good asset but a little bit higher operating expense per BOE than we want to have in the mix right now.,1
"The longer answer, Mike, is that for modest amounts invested in rental compressors or even compressors that we own, we can kick that capacity up if the volumes become available to us.",1
"This includes $49.3 million of growth capital, of which approximately $3.6 million was reimbursed, and $13.8 million of maintenance capital, of which $2.5 million was reimbursed.",1
"As Scott mentioned, the newly acquired assets contributed approximately $5.4 million of EBITDA during the portion of the quarter that we owned them.",0
"During the quarter, we completed new inbound and outbound interconnections on the High Plains Pipeline system in North Dakota, which enhanced producers optionality to move crude oil through our system to the different basin exit points.",1
"In February, we successfully raised approximately $284 million in gross proceeds from a public offering of 5 million common units.",1
"We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position at $2.6 billion at period end, consisting of available cash and undrawn debt facilities.",1
"We've run tests during first half that have shown that the capacity is there on the plant if we opt to enhance the existing facility, but we're also considering expressions of interest for a small standalone train and we'll hopefully be able to make a decision on the concept to move forward in the second half of this year.",1
"Our business performance was driven by the successful integration of the Rockies natural gas business, delivery of several organic growth projects like the Connolly Gathering System, and contributions from the Los Angeles storage and pipeline assets acquisition.",1
"I'm hopeful that we will receive approval from the joint venture partners shortly, allowing us to move quickly into basis of design.",0
"By balanced, we are talking about access to an appropriate mix of opportunities in frontier, emerging and mature petroleum systems.",1
"As such, we are well placed to compete in an environment that supports creative, innovative thinking, and exploits the best of the sciences at our disposal.",1
"However, we see substantial growth beyond this project in the Permian, and look forward to sharing more about our growth plans at our upcoming Investor and Analyst Day.",1
"Looking ahead, you can find details of our volume expectations and other elements related to our fourth quarter 2017 outlook in our earnings release issued yesterday.",0
The second part of the agreement was the proposed purchase by Woodside of a further 9.5% of shareholding through a selective buyback subject to shareholder approval.,0
We are also well-positioned to capture additional gathering volumes on acreage dedicated to us as production grows and we make new connections as well as compete for and win bids for new systems.,1
"Over the last 20 years, both USA Compression and CDM build strong businesses taking care of customers who are part of this infrastructure build out.",1
The second quarter got a good start on both as leverage decreased to 4.4 times including our senior notes and outstanding borrowings under the revolver of $950 million.,1
"With me today, along with Greg Holloway, our Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary, is Jody Tusa, the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of USA Compression.",0
"I know you're waiting kind of well results to actually talk about the physical play itself, but just curious if you could give us an idea of what region that is and ‚Äì or maybe what formation you're looking at potentially testing?",0
"On January 23, 2014, we announced a cash distribution of $0.48 per common unit and subordinated units, which represented a 4.3% increase over the third quarter.",1
"However, if we exclude the volumes in 2013 related to the working interest sold to Legacy during the second quarter of 2014, our production volumes increased by 5%.",1
"Importantly, we're also taking the time to make sure that we lock these improvements in place so that the savings become an size benefit versus just a one-time gain.",1
"So, needless to say, we are optimistic about the balance of the year ahead and what we see looking into 2018 as well.",1
Our based budget plan includes completion of six wells that will come online in March as part of the capital flexibility that Rick was talking about.,0
"The next big data point for San Juan is the West Lybrook pad, which is still on schedule come online for sale this summer.",0
"For the first quarter, we are reporting an adjusted EBITDAX of $131 million, which is $68 million lower than the first quarter of prior year.",-1
"Cash operating expenses were flat compared to prior year, despite an overall increase associated with having Delaware results reflected in the first quarter of this year.",1
"As it regards the distribution amount, our management team believes that the prudent course of action is to conserve cash until such time when the market rewards an increased distribution.",1
"Now I want to draw your attention to what we're going to do for an encore, and if you look at our track record you should have very high expectations because we certainly do.",1
We continue to believe that both the gas supply and gas demand factors appear to be robust in future years as well.,0
"At the end of the second quarter, we had $850 million of total liquidity which includes $100 million of cash and cash equivalents and $750 million available under the revolver.",0
We now have San Juan oil growth machine up and running and we'll see steady growth over the next several quarters.,1
"The reduction in EBITDAX is primarily driven by lower realizations on our commodity hedges, which was mostly offset by higher oil production and higher margins achieved on that production.",-1
The partnership also increased its cash distributions for the third quarter 2015 to $0.3075 per unit that's a year-over-year growth rate of 28%.,1
"Terminal volume was higher than the first quarter of 2016, mainly due to the contributions from the McKee, Meraux and Three Rivers terminals, which were acquired subsequent to the first quarter of last year.",0
"There's plenty of work to do and lots of steps ahead, but we're making progress, advancing the ball down the field and putting ourselves in position to do what needs to be done.",1
I emphasized that last quarter that we are seeing this improvement and now our financial statements are starting to reflect it.,1
"At this time, we can now open the line for questions and I'll turn it back over to the operator.",0
"As you can see, as we have taken the cash that we had on the balance sheet at the beginning of 2017, and embraced our drill bit deleveraging strategy, our amazing assets have driven our net debt to EBITDA from a high of 5.5 turns down to 2.4 turns.",1
"All of this gives us the luxury of being able to weigh the variety of levers
that are available to us as we continue to enhance value for shareholders.",1
"And hence, the debate also with the government concerning temporary ways to be ‚Äì of support, to subsidize this technology, which is in  dire state (3:28), but it's still of paramount importance for the energy balance in the country.",0
We have lower provisions from a favorable risk profile and lower debt services due to the financial optimization and financial market trends as well.,1
"And the adjusted net income of ‚Ç¨156 million with ‚Äì okay, that's not the end of my section says Patrizia Savi.",0
"We'll increase our capacity also to treat the waste, which is again in line with this period and the strategy of the business plan.",1
"Netting all these quote-unquote ‚Äì non-recurring effects, the organic growth has been about 2%, with increase in numbers of customers, high volumes both in the existing as well as clearly volumes generated by the new customers, and on the other side, a reduction in the unit margin close to 10%.",1
But this must be observed very carefully because the net result is influenced by extraordinary terms when compared with the first half year 2012 for the decrease of ‚Ç¨40 million.,-1
"We have sold the entire long position we had on the green certificates as we anticipated, which means that we were sold an amount of green certificates of ‚Ç¨63 million in the first half, basically ‚Ç¨38 million up versus 2017.",1
"Potential upsides in the regulated businesses, and our CCGT fleet still competitive with MSD, of course, on a smaller amount in size.",0
"Moving to page 44, basically on Reshape, so A2A smart city, so we have two blocks: smart city and energy efficiency.",1
"On the generation, we have made a very good second quarter, pretty much in line with same quarter as last year, only ‚Ç¨4 million behind versus a shortfall in Q1 of ‚Ç¨24 million.",-1
"We don't change our view versus what we already commented on the cost of debt on the full year, which will remain around 3.1%, 3.2%, and as well as on the tax rate that which we confirm in the region of 31%, 32%.",0
We are working hard to further simplify our portfolio by continuing to exit those markets and businesses where we do not have a compelling competitive advantage.,1
"Over the last couple of months, the government of Bulgaria has passed new laws which, once implemented, should help improve NEK's financial position.",1

"Joining me today are Andr√©s Gluski, our Chief Executive Officer, Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer, and other senior members of our management team.",0
"This leaves about $200 million to $300 million of discretionary cash to be allocated this year, plus as we announced additional asset sales of roughly $500 million to $700 million by 2015, the amount of discretionary cash available will increase.",1
"Furthermore, we are making progress on our advanced pipeline of development projects, including platform expansions, adjacencies and enhancements and select platform expansion acquisitions.",1

"As many of you are aware, in order to stimulate the economy the government of Brazil recently announced an energy cost reduction program or Provisional Measure 579, which targets a 20% reduction in electricity prices.",0
"This measure was calculated by taking the pre-tax earnings from each business, putting those accounted for as equity and earnings and adjusting for ownership percentage.",0
"It is  partially offset by improved performance at our businesses in Chile, IPL, in the U. S. and the additional cost savings we recently announced.",1
"Even so, year-on-year Retail gross margin lifted 9%, or A$63 million driven primarily by close management of tariff increases across all states.",1

"We achieved almost 9.5% EBITDA growth, and we are very satisfied with these positive results obtained in the first half, while we registered a very significant increase in EBITDA.",1
"Moving to the medium and long-term, 55% of our future generation has been committed through contracts beyond five-year terms and 19% through contracts with a term over 10 years.",0
"Net income decreased by 3.1% to $511 million, mainly as a result of the one-time effect mentioned earlier in Argentina for $67 million.",-1

Let me anticipate to you that this presentation will show results to only for the perimeter of Enersis Am√©ricas without Chile on a pro forma basis.,0
On the left part of the slide in distribution Enel Am√©ricas has decreased by $77 million or 8% total OpEx.,-1
"In terms of economic and financial impacts based on our understanding of the new regulatory framework for distribution, we estimate a positive impact to EBITDA compared to the strategic plan announced in November, which is still early to quantify in full but might get about $300 million in the total period 2017-2019.",1
"Nowadays, Brazilian reservoirs in our areas are up 25% capacity in the southeast region and 22% in the northeast region.",1

"Before ending this conference call, on slide 14, I would like to highlight the most important issues during this period.",0
"In addition, all revenues and cost from non-Chilean investments were considered as discontinued operations and consequently were all registered as net income from discontinued operations in the income statement.",-1
"Having said that in this half only 2% of the total energy sales were sold in Chile in the spot market, 1% higher than the first quarter.",0
"The estimated effects for Endesa Chile will be additional earnings of approximately $104 million and a reduction of financial debt of approximately $138 million, which will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements as of December 2014.",0
"These factors include a decline in the equity capital market of the United States or Chile, an increase in the market rates of interest in the United States or elsewhere, adverse decisions by government regulators in Chile or elsewhere and other factors described in Endesa Chile's Annual Report on Form 20-F, including under Risk Factors.",-1
"Hydrological conditions in the Southeast and Northeast system where Cachoeira, Dourada and Fortaleza are located were lower than the previous month this year.",0
"The average power prices in Italy and Spain increased remarkably as a consequence of several extraordinary factors such as higher demand, lower hydro and wind sources, and lower variability of the French nuclear fleet.",1
"In Italy and Iberia, Networks growth CapEx increased by 50%, thanks to the rollout of smart meters ‚Äì smart grid ‚Äì sorry, smart meters, remote control, and quality programs.",1
"Then we have a slightly positive contribution from Renewables in LatAm, where the impact of lower resource availability is more than offset by higher margins in Chile and Brazil.",1
"Worth mentioning that we recorded in the period a negative scenario and margins impact of ‚Ç¨724 million, which provides an indication of the really challenging context in which we operated in 2017.",-1
"Group tax rate decreased by around 2% reaching 27.6% level of tax rate, thanks to the positive impact deriving from the recognition of deferred tax assets in Italy already booked in the first quarter.",-1
"This unique mix of different geographies and production types, as well as the residential customers, gives us a competitive advantage over our peers.",1
"And we expected last year to reach about ‚Ç¨4 billion cumulative OpEx reduction by 2017, leveraging major actions on both personnel and external costs.",1
And this has been offset by the deconsolidation of the Slovensk√© elektr√°rne on one side and the extension of renewable assets useful life discounted around minus ‚Ç¨100 million in the period.,0
"And regarding prices, in Colombia, there is no longer the El Ni√±o effect, which caused drought emergency in the first quarter and prices are stabilizing versus the peak recorded during the first part of the year.",-1
"This thanks to higher free power margin of roughly ‚Ç¨220 million driven by higher volumes; larger free customer base of 700,000,  (24:22) customer more and higher unitary margin; higher regulated margin for ‚Ç¨51 million; gas market for ‚Ç¨90 million; and lower cost to serve for minus ‚Ç¨40 million.",1
"Cash flow rose by around ‚Ç¨1.5 billion, or plus 50%, year-on-year, while we improved EBITDA cash conversion from 40% to 60%.",1
"And, of course, in the performance of Pec√©m and even on the potential anticipation of Cachoeira Caldeir√£o, the new hydro that was in the first version expected for January 2017 and now we expect it for the beginning of 2016.",0
"I would highlight that our net debt to EBITDA ratio goes down from 4.4 to 4.2, supported on decline of regulatory receivables.",-1
"And average debt maturity was extended to 4.4 years in March, following essentially the new five-year revolving facility signed in February 2015.",0
"So, basically what we were expecting to be recovered in three years ‚Äì maximum four years, it was basically extended to a 10 years period.",0
"Another source of earnings enhancement is clearly to pay down the most expensive debt and raising funding from cheaper available sources, thus gradually decreasing our average cost of debt.",-1
"We had a ‚Ç¨1.5 billion securitization, more than two-thirds of it from Portugal, so we cashed ‚Ç¨1.5 billion and the increase was slightly lower.",1
"The beginning of 2014 is showing also positive signs in terms of power demand and in terms of CO2 prices, which went up significantly in the last two months.",1
"By August 4, we will have clear visibility on the exact impact of the net debt from the combined deals of natural gas disposal plus the tender offer of EDPR.",0
"And also, we are including ‚Ç¨0.3 billion of income tax paid in May 2017, but fully related with the proceeds in 2016 regarding tariff securitization in Portugal which were at a very high level, as you know, last year.",0
"We can see that electricity demand went up by 1.6% in Iberia, with the split between 1.8% at ‚Äì in Spain and 0.3% in Portugal on a mixed effect from economic recovery and mild weather conditions.",1
"Moving to the evolution of net debt during 2014, we can see that it fell by ‚Ç¨41 million to ‚Ç¨17 billion by end of the year.",0
"4% down as the 8% underlying growth, mostly driven by renewables in Brazil, was eroded by forex and regulation in Portugal.",-1
"And also the material tariff updates implemented by the regulator with the support from the government, which also reduced the regulatory receivables at level of our distribution companies.",0
"And finally, in Brazil operating costs in local currency went up 5%, clearly below inflation in the period, and including also 45 days of Pec√©m operating costs.",1
"It includes also, of course, as normally in the second quarter, the full payment of the annual dividend in cash of ‚Ç¨670 million which always impacts our second quarter net debt figure.",0
"In my view, this is a clear vote implicitly also for a carbon-free or carbon-neutral power generation and it will have its impact on the future energy production landscape.",0
"We want to make sure that with all the operating integrity and the challenge that we have at hand at the moment, we don't lose sight of opportunities ahead, threats ahead, understanding the marketplace, understanding customer expectation, technical developments and the likes, to be prepared and give our company, particularly the employees, a good amount of orientation to stay focused on keeping the company on track.",0
The main reasons for the decline in revenue are lower sales volumes in the electricity and gas sector as well as an ongoing downward trend in the electricity price.,-1
You can partly pin the gas sales development of the B2B customers down to the increasing gas demand due to the colder weather conditions compared to last year's first nine months.,-1
This development brings me directly to slide number 13 and the answer to the question how can we manage the implementation of our strategy in this environment.,0
"Based on our Strategy 2020, we are concentrating on organic growth with a total investment of ‚Ç¨3.5 billion in renewable energy from 2012 to 2020.",1
"By the end of the year, we still assume a decrease of our adjusted EBITDA between 0% and minus 5% compared to 2014.",-1
"The adjusted EBITDA of the Renewable Energies segment decreased, as expected, from ‚Ç¨43 million in Q1 2014 by 17% to ‚Ç¨36 million in Q1 2015, mainly driven by negative generation margin effects for run-of-river plants to the ongoing price pressure on the wholesale market.",-1
"We are always thinking about how can we grow into the new area of, say 2,020-plus products, which ultimately will have different shape and functionalities when IT, digital and energy business would some sort of come together.",1
This includes the sale of Grids as part of the re-municipalization and also the successful realization of participation model mainly in the area of onshore wind.,1
"In our forecast for 2017, we had expected an adjusted EBITDA between zero and plus 5% above 2016, and that's a stop of the negative trend.",1
"We consider we still have an important room for maneuver, shared service centers, streamlining of support functions and operational efficiency ‚Äì we will continue to add ‚Äì to review our assets fleet.",1
"However, as usual, the cash generation has been very strong, with the CFFO at ‚Ç¨9.8 billion, up ‚Ç¨1.9 billion year-over-year.",1
"Our bottom line on recurrent income basis reached ‚Ç¨2.4 billion, close to the ‚Ç¨2.5 billion of the first semester of last year.",0
"Net recurring income group share between ‚Ç¨3.1 billion and ‚Ç¨3.5 billion, gross CapEx between ‚Ç¨7 billion and ‚Ç¨8 billion, with around ‚Ç¨3 billion for maintenance and ‚Ç¨4 billion to ‚Ç¨5 billion for growth.",1

"Note that operational results exclude special items from the decision to close Vermont Yankee, HCM implementation, and the transmission spin-merge effort terminated in 2013.",0
"First, non-fuel O&M was higher as benefits from our cost management efforts were offset by higher nuclear spending to improve operations, timing of  spending and other increases, such as MISO administrative fees, which were offset elsewhere in the income statement.",1
"Excluding VY, net revenue was still the main driver for the EBITDA decline, as wholesale energy prices in the first quarter of last year were significantly higher.",-1
We will persist in looking for every opportunity to control O&M cost as part of our plan to meet our commitments to all our key stakeholders.,-1
"In a partnership with the Louisiana Civil Justice Center and the Orleans Parish Civil District Court, our lawyers helped to establish and staffed the self-help Resource Center.",0

They currently have requested $49.7 million of rate relief in pending cases and this includes $37.3 million in implemented interim rates and $12.4 million in rate relief from additional pending cases.,0
"At this point, we're not going to discuss further specifics about the sale process other than to say that we expect to pursue the sale process in a deliberate and thorough manner.",-1
"We expect to continue to develop our acreage with three operated rigs, one each in the Bakken, the Paradox and East Texas.",0
We expect to fund our approximately $583 million in planned gross CapEx this year largely with cash flows from operations along with some debt and proceeds from non-strategic divestitures.,0
We'll continue to focus on and build on the momentum of these streamlined businesses and create long-term value for our shareholders.,0
"The decrease in earnings reflects lower asphalt product margins due to increased competition in certain regions, resulting in lower volumes, and lower construction margins due to less available work in our energy-producing states.",-1
"As you may recall, the Charbonneau and Line Section 25 expansion projects, which include a new compressor station, as well as other compression additions and enhancements were placed into service in the second quarter.",1
"And based on these results and our forecast for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing our earnings guidance to a range of $1.10 to $1.20 per share.",0
"And our pipeline will be bringing an outstanding project online in our diesel refinery later this year, and again is in the midst of an open season of our proposed Dakota pipeline, which will dramatically expand our pipeline system.",1
"Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $92.3 million, or $0.49 per share, compared to $71.9 million, or $0.38 per share last year, a 29% increase.",1
"This is another reason why we will focus our performance measures on returns, as it shows the true underlying performance of the business against the regulatory contract.",0
"At that time, based on the latest forecasts for generation construction in the UK and, therefore, our connection activities, our planned activities for non-load related work for our regulated businesses remain the same.",0
"And importantly, Ofgem is now focused on putting a framework together to allow a reasonable level of certainly around the financial aspects of these investments, whilst at the same time making sure these projects, of course, are efficient and competitive.",1
"Again, you will see that this means the pro forma continuing EPS would be around ¬£0.07 lower than the current year underlying EPS.",0
"In Electricity Transmission, we've completed all of the maintenance that we planned through the summer to ensure that the system has maximum availability and minimum constraints for the winter period.",0
Our U. S. business is generating higher growth than we expected and we now anticipate rate-based growth for the year of around 7%.,1
"But that only tells part of the story, because there are another 30,000 homes and businesses that still don't have power.",0
"We've invested over ¬£800 million in the first six months in UK transmission, a 34% increase over the prior year.",1
"On the UK regulatory process, I've already shared a few thoughts about the process and our progress to date and the approach we've been taking, as we work towards an appropriate conclusion early next year.",1
"In a world where every aspect of company's activities these days are under constant and intense scrutiny, recognition of strong performance in this area is an important achievement.",1
"As a result, we expect revenue reductions in Electricity Transmission relating to the totex efficiency and load-related outputs that we highlighted last year.",1
We also intend to submit rate case filings for our Massachusetts Gas and Rhode Island gas and electric businesses this month.,0
"For Gas Transmission, operating profit was flat on a headline basis at ¬£159 million, which included ¬£7 million lower timing benefits.",1
We expect a good outturn on the annual revenue incentive schemes and our additional allowances are expected to be similar to last year.,1
The total investment will be about ‚Ç¨85 million and it will start up ‚Äì we expect it to start up at the end of 2017 with a full EPC contract.,1
We are in a very complicated environment especially in the commodity prices due to the hydrocarbon market and exchange rates.,-1
"As regards gas and electricity networks, we have to underline an increase as a result of the purchase of the Chilean company, CGE.",1
"As regards the wholesale gas business, we have signed agreements for 11 bcms associated with different projects, two in the U. S., Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi.",0
"But we want to be very careful, so that in the immediate future the commercial aspects will be ‚Äì we think that they will actually affect the supply prices.",0
So naturally this year is the year where we have to be delayed and this is going to affect our regulated income taking into account that the cost we have to pay for the inspection costs.,0
"The negative impact of these two factors, the hydro production and the non-transfer of the increase of production cost towards the final market is around ‚Ç¨110 million, so these are difficult cases.",-1
"The second one will take place November this year and next year, the third one ‚Äì this situation becoming truly regularized in Argentina.",0
"And finally, the emergence of new technologies and digitization, massive digitization, will produce new models, business models, which will transform the sector, especially in what has to do with customers.",0
And one of our ideas within the strategic plan is to change the mix of the portfolio of global power generation and have a greater amount of renewable energies.,1
"As to net debt evolution this year, this has stayed relatively stable throughout the year due to the strong cash generation and despite the dividend payout and investments.",1
"The current investment meant 47% of the total amount investments of ‚Ç¨744 million, mainly focusing in networks in Latin America and electricity generation internationally.",0
"At any rate, we expect a significant improvement in gas businesses and an improvement, which should consolidate throughout the year when the hydro situation as well as the electricity market situations or in the end the translation of the production situation to final prices consolidates.",1
"Other highlights for 2014 are, first of all, the launching of the Global Power, the GPG company, which is going to act all over the world outside Europe this year in addition to analyzing the possibilities that we have in whole of the world.",0
"We think that in the LNG, in accordance with the Wood Mackenzie statistics for 2030, 300 additional bcms will be required.",1
"And the trend seems to be that gas has reached ‚Äì well, not now, but we should strike a balance in the past because the drops are being compensated by the new customers that were getting on-board.",0
"We've done our calculations in devaluated currency and the CapEx increases not only because of the five-year gasification projects that we're negotiating, but also as a result of electric generation where we are finishing and completing our plants in Torito and be Bii Hioxo and they require that investment.",1
We have got flexibility and contracts that allow us to use this LNG to enter into specific markets where they may have specific needs at a certain moment of time.,1
We have a very serious problem because entrance into the system of energy at ‚Ç¨0 such that the wholesale market is not working properly.,-1
"As you can see in this graph, we increased our sales to Europe by 36% through organizations with our own network like Benelux or other countries where we market to end users.",1
"This has all generated ‚Äì has generated some cash generation covering CapEx needs and also the dividend policy which this year, had an extraordinary nature higher than normal.",0
"So from now on, they will not be considered permanent asset of the company or current business of the company.",0
"And now moving into gas supply, we will increase volumes by around 6% and this increase will be the consequence of the new supply from the U. S., which will be adjusted with a reduction in the spot gas that we have used this year, because of very favorable situations mainly in the north of Europe.",1
"And now in Argentina also last in June the Secretary for Energy, the authorities for energy, brought out a new rule for gas distribution for transit ‚Äì for temporary financial assistance and they set up a series of ‚Äì aimed at maintaining the chain of payments in O&M in attendance for the implementation of the tariff review.",0
"If these regulations weren't ‚Äì or if this framework was different as from the next half year, the regulation effect will have been absorbed because it's applied in the second half.",0
But the price of Brent has dropped almost 46% as regards the previous year but it's also true that there are several mitigating factors.,-1
They're very sensitive to energy markets and contracts are usually for high volumes and the average length is three years to five years period for these contracts.,0
"Regulatory six year periods have been set up and also the rules to administer this sector, which as you know, did not have important problems, but did have some specific moderate imbalances that would now be corrected.",-1
"However, this amount includes, as debt is still pending, nearly ‚Ç¨600 million in tariff deficit, of which ‚Ç¨436 million corresponds last year and ‚Ç¨155 million to this year, up to this date.",1
"So we can start with the Q&A session now, and we will start by the questions from people sitting in this room.",0
"Looking across NiSource, I'd note that we're fully on track with our overall capital investment program, which you'll recall is targeted to reach approximately $1.8 billion in 2013 and we continue to support those investments with a balanced and disciplined corporate financing strategy, the most recent example being the issuance earlier this month of $750 million in 30-year notes at a very attractive rate.",1
"Before turning the call back to Bob, I would like to take the opportunity to reiterate NiSource's core financial commitments which are: maintaining our stable investment grade credit ratings, growing earnings by 5% to 7% annually, growing the dividend by 3% to 5% annually, and maintaining a strong liquidity position, all while supporting our approximately $2 billion investment program.",1
On a GAAP basis earning come from continuing operations for the quarter was about $50 million or $0.16 per share compared to about $17 million or $0.05 per share in the third quarter of last year.,1
"As you can see, our CPG agenda is rich with activity, designed to strengthen customer service, assure the continued reliability on of our system, and support the development of the Birkling Shell supplies.",1
"And as Bob mentioned, I'm pleased to reiterate that our capital program for 2014 remains on track at about $2.2 billion.",1
"By the end of the year, the company will file with the FERC to recover cost for the second year of modernization investments.",0
"Consistent with the May 26 settlement, NIPSCO reached with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor and NIPSCO's largest industrial customers, the company filed a base rate case on October 1 and is expected to file a new seven-year electric infrastructure modernization plan with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission or IURC by early 2016.",0
"Now, I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure and regulatory highlights across our utilities.",0
"In addition to our refinancing activities, we issued another $1 billion in new debt, which will use the finance investment in our infrastructure modernization programs.",0
"And then after that, it really is around and that's why we remain committed to the 5% to 7% growth in earnings and dividends.",1
And the weighted average maturity in our long-term debt was approximately 18 years and the weighted average interest rate with approximately 4.7%.,0
"Significant that our ownership of Beethoven will produce over the life of that project significant benefits for our customers which, of course, was the basis of the Commission's approval.",1
"We're looking forward to seeing the Commission's final order within the next several weeks, and we will read it carefully and we'll evaluate our options at that time.",0
"Our diluted share count was about 1.4 million higher this quarter than Q2 last year due to share issuances under our equity shelf program, but the $2.9 million increase in net income more than offset the dilution resulting in a $0.06 per share improvement in EPS, I mentioned earlier.",1
So as such we continue to seek opportunities to acquire another 13% or so to reach our 50% target and potentially also incremental reserves as fuel for electric generation including at Dave Gates.,1
"At the top of that ‚Äì well, to the far right of that page, I would note that our non-GAAP adjusted EPS of $2.68 is $0.18 or a 7% improvement over our 2013 non-GAAP earnings.",1
"That was really drive by relatively flat gross margin on a year-over-year basis, flat operating expenses on a year-over-year basis, resulting of course in flat operating income.",0
"Also, I'd point out that $2.2 million hydro transaction costs, that's a reduction in year-over-year expense from the prior quarter ‚Äì prior year's quarter.",0
"The biggest driver for that decrease on a year-over-year basis was approximately $38 million of refunds to customers, $30.8 million associated with our DGGS FERC customers based upon our ruling to provide refunds to customers there, and a $7.2 million refund to our South Dakota electric customers for the difference between interim and final rates in our South Dakota rate case.",-1
"So you can see that even though we were down $10 million from a pre-tax perspective, we certainly should see improvement on a going-forward basis there.",1
"And as always, I'll point out that if other opportunities arise that are not included in these projections, new equity funding could be available.",0
"You may also notice that we did have a bit warmer summer, but that had very little impact on our business, and I think if you look at the amount of heating degree days we have versus cooling degree days, in Montana we have 19 times more heating degree days than cooling degree days and nine times more in South Dakota.",-1
"Our Montana electric supply resource plan will be filed by the end of this quarter and as we've talked about, that's a very important document where we will lay out the foundation for operating a diverse energy portfolio in Montana with a particular focus on how we will meet our capacity needs going forward, alternatives to meet our capacity needs and again to optimize operation of this system for the benefit of our customers.",1
"And today we're calling in from our Division Operations Office in Helena, Montana where our board has been meeting this week.",0
"It's great opportunity for them to learn more about the company, spend time with senior leadership, spend time with board of directors.",1
Also we enjoyed meeting with a number of you at our Analyst Day in December and the feedback after that as well.,1
"Before moving on to our businesses, I would like to point out that the $0.01 loss at the holding company is primarily a result of transaction costs associated with the formation of Enable Midstream Partners.",0
"In addition, because Enable Midstream is in the process of an initial public offering, we will not be discussing or answering any questions regarding the guidance for Enable or the S-1 filing.",0
"Speaking of costs, we continue to wait on the Regional Haze ruling from the 10th Circuit Court which is expected ‚Äì the ruling is expected sometime this summer.",0
The latest economic statistics for the Oklahoma City's unemployment rate is just under 4% and has stayed at just over 4%.,0
"In terms of the call today, we will first hear from Pete, followed by a regulatory update from Sean, and an explanation from Steve of first quarter results.",0
"Turning to our interest in Enable, for the second quarter of 2014, natural gas midstream operations contributed after-tax activity income to OGE Energy Corp.",1
"For the Midstream business, we are projecting the earnings contribution to be between $0.48 and $0.52 per average diluted share.",0
"That manifests in a lower cost to serve overall, particularly through a lower cost to acquire and a more efficient operation.",1
"And to the extent that you might look at the data and sort of look at wells in production and total production and try and draw some conclusions about productivity per well, you can't, because a lot of wells are now throttled back.",0
So our capacity to produce gas was increased when we brought Geographe online and completed some other projects like the inlet compression project at Otway.,1
"Clearly, there's a lot of points and themes in there that need to be drawn out in more detail, but the usual way we do that, of course, is just after the financials.",0
"Many of will have had a chance to look at them but Contact, again has certainly stabilized its position both its competitive position in terms of customer numbers but its earnings as well.",1
"And I perhaps should have made the comment earlier and I'll make it here, I should have made it earlier on the slides, the way Origin runs its portfolio is that we do run an open position of the pool clearly within risk limits.",0
"So, ladies and gentlemen, hopefully that's been ‚Äì given you a reason understanding what we've done over the last six months, what's been achieved and the things that excite us about the future.",0
"Returns have improved, but you'll note that the ongoing returns in this business are still only 8.4% on our capital employed.",1
And really what we've done is just drawn out some of the points on the right hand side that reinforce what I've said to you over the last couple of slides.,0
"At the back of the pack, we've added two pages that sort of show how did those two separate out, with the segment notice reflecting as you see on this page.",0
"There's much more ‚Äì I'm sorry, much more, that's a relative term, but you can say that the incidence of prices higher than AUD 300 a megawatt hour is increasing relative to the prior year and that is the main driver of increases in overall wholesale cost of electricity.",1
"And, in broad terms, if you think about the mix of the major fields or resources that have broadened the production, Talinga, Condabri, Orana, Spring Gully and Combabula are really great.",1
"Of course, D&A will ‚Äì more like ‚Äì will be a full year impact next year and we'll have Te Mihi coming through as well, so that D&A will step up even though the capital program is starting to come down.",-1
"And Contact sometimes people ask, is this an after tax or before tax, is it an equivalent reflection and it is an equivalent reflection.",0
The net effect of that chart is that gross profit per unit of sales is down A$6 a megawatt hour.,-1
"And what you're going to see there is that when we break it down, as we do into maintenance costs or cost to serve versus acquisition/retention costs, our maintenance costs were down.",-1
We work pretty hard on the upstream to defer and figure out how to manage through that period to hold that contribution that remaining contribution that I was going to make and all the shareholders were going to make to complete APLNG to commitment that we made earlier on we have done.,-1
"In terms of natural gas, I think you can see in the results, the strength of our competitive position has really started to show out.",1
"So we think we'll be into sustainable production from around about that time, pretty much consistent with the schedule as we've articulated for quite some time.",0
"As we have previously communicated, the consenting phase is still ongoing at Hornsea 3 project, and we expect to have key consenting in place during the autumn of 2019, which would make the project eligible to participate in an expected fourth CfD auction at a later point in time.",0
"So, in terms of the P&L, in terms of the balance sheet and our rating foundation, the company has never been stronger than it is right now.",1
"It was only slightly up on 2015, and the reason why it was the relatively contained step-up is mostly driven by 2016 being a fairly poor wind year.",-1
"A lot of exciting stuff, and that's all on top of the construction program covering six major double-digit billion kroner investment, which is currently being move forward as well.",1
This item alone accounted for $1.9 million reduction in net earnings between the years and lower tooling revenues also contributed to BTD's revenue decline.,0
"The transformation of our company has also been recognized by Standard & Poor's, who recently upgraded Otter Tail Corporation and Otter Tail Power's corporate senior unsecured credit ratings.",0
"The rates would remain in effect until the South Dakota Commission makes a final determination on our overall request, which we expect within 12 months.",-1
"I our June 1 resource plan filing with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, we proposed adding 200 megawatts of wind, 30 megawatts of solar and 248 megawatts of natural gas during the next five years to reliably serve our customers.",0
"Moody's recently announced a favorable change in outlook for both Otter Tail Corporation and Otter Tail Power, joining other rating agencies, who have recently either upgraded their ratings or the outlook for both the Corporation and Otter Tail Power Company.",1
"As we narrow our focus to our Electric business and a tighter portfolio of manufacturing and infrastructure businesses, management and the board of directors are better able to understand and improve our companies, using more targeted and disciplined approach.",1
"Key ordering points included a five-year action plan with the addition of up to 200 megawatts of wind, 30 megawatts of solar, and 250 megawatts of peaking capacity in 2021.",1
BTD has begun a $12.1 million expansion at its production facility in Lakeville to accommodate the addition of paint and assembly services to serve these customers.,0
"Shifting to the electric part of the business, last quarter, we talked about our record level of electric reliability in 2012.",1
"With respect to the criminal investigation, we continue to provide information as requested by the Federal State and county attorney.",-1
The lower end of the range reflects recent spending levels across the utility with a few adjustments for known changes such as the conclusion of  our Cornerstone Program and the Utility's Solar Voltage program.,0
"For example, we expect to continue to under-earn on our gas transmission and storage business since we won't have the opportunity to true up our cost and revenues there until 2015.",1
"You recall that the GRC sets base revenues through 2016 for three key parts of our company: electric distribution, gas distribution and electric generation.",-1
It would also deny our request to treat every gas odor call as requiring immediate response instead of screening some out for later action.,-1
"With these tax benefits included, we now believe that these factors taken together could result in an overall positive of roughly $0.25 per share for the year.",1
"Our pipeline-related expenses came in at $102 million for the quarter and $347 million for the year, which was just below our guidance range.",1
Kent has done a tremendous job managing PG&E's financial activities during challenges that were some of the most complex in our industry.,-1
"I'd encourage all of you to have the presentation in front of you as I share my comments, because I think, it will be a little easier to follow alone.",1
"Finally, just a few words on cash flows, on a net basis, we do not expect these proposed tax reforms to have a significant near-term impact on cash flows.",0
"And in addition, at certain times during the heat wave, more than half of PG&E's energy supply was met with RPS eligible resources.",0
"And while we are providing guidance beyond 2017, our objective is to earn the recently authorized return on equity across the enterprise for 2018 and 2019.",0
"In terms of the impact on revenues, we anticipate that the revenue we collect from our customers will be reduced by approximately $500 million annually as a result of the lower corporate tax rate.",0
"Our most recent updates for these release items as filed on July 17, led to an additional $19 million of revenue requirements for an estimated total increase of approximately $79 million.",1
"For the full year, including the effects of replacement power costs, for the coal plant outages, we expect the net variable power cost to be within the PCAM debt balance.",0
"New prices went into effect in August 1, 2016, which include the return on and of Carty's capital across the $514 million and operating cost as allowed by the OPUC in the 2016 general rate case.",0
"In 2014, we achieved several key objectives towards meeting our customer's energy needs and I'm pleased to share our results with you this morning.",1
"Once the IRP and the associated action plan is acknowledged, we expect to issue one or more RFPs to acquire needed resources.",0
"In the past quarter, a transportation manufacturing company announced increased demand for a barge and rail cars, construction began on a new data center, which is expected to be operational by mid-2015, and there is continued expansion at the Port of Portland.",1

"PGE signed a memorandum of understanding with the Bonneville Power Administration in January to explore a collaborative regional solution that could provide up to 2,600 megawatts of transmission capacity.",1
"Turning to slide 19, our updated investment plan drives CAGR of about 7% in our projected rate base to 2019, driving value for both our customers and our shareowners.",1
"Looking at slide 5, you can see that robust rate base growth, combined with jurisdictions that permit near real-time recovery of our infrastructure investments, is what will drive our targeted 4% to 6% earnings growth.",1
"The projects  capping and closing remaining ash plants at our coal-fired power plants, building process order facilities and completing the second phase of the dry storage landfill projects at our E. W. Brown Generating Station.",0
"As you know, prior to the year-end 2015, passage of the past ‚Äì PASS Act by Congress extended 50% bonus depreciation from 2015 through 2017 with the phase out reduction in bonus to 40% from 2018 and 30% in 2019 with 0% thereafter.",0
"Let's move to a more detailed review of the first quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on slide 11.",0
"So if market rates are around $.120 per pound when we execute the 2018 restrike, we would be able to hedge a 100% of 2019 earnings at our budgeted rate leaving no additional currency exposure for 2019.",1
I should point out that included in our 2017 forecast is $0.05 of hedged restrikes to move value from 2017 to 2019.,0
"It also will give Louisville Gas and Electric the ability to improve natural gas safety and reliability by replacing the aging natural gas service ‚Äì field service lines, with new plastic lines that run from the street to our customers' homes.",1

"Overall, we saw about $0.02 improvement compared to the prior year due to weather with domestic weather driving a $0.04 improvement from Q1 2017, partially offset by $0.02 of unfavorable weather in the UK.",1
This result was driven primarily by higher transmission margins from additional capital investments and higher peak transmission system demand in 2018.,0
We remain on track to meet our objectives of full year 2013 operating earnings of $2.25 to $2.50 per share.,0
"The board of directors for the Long Island Power Authority, or LIPA, recently approved amendments to PSEG Long Island's original operating services agreement for LIPA's transmission and distribution system.",0
"The new agreement will provide for an increase in our operating fee in 2016 and beginning in 2015, Power will provide LIPA with fuel procurement and power management services.",1
The results for the fourth quarter brought the full year 2013 to an operating loss of about $13 million or $0.03 per share compared with 2012's operating earnings of $45 million or $0.09 per share.,-1
PSE&G's operating earnings increased 22% during the first half of the year and supports maintenance of our forecast for growth in operating earnings for 2014 to $705 million to $745 million.,1
Power has slightly increased its forecast of economic generation for 2015 and 2016 to 55 to 57 terawatt hours per year from the previous 54 to 56 terawatt hours.,1
We also have posted a series of slides that detail operating results by company for the quarter and the first half of the year.,0
"Finally, just on a personal note, as you know I had announced a week ago my plans to retire from PSEG during the fourth quarter.",0
"The power markets over the last month have seen prices move to higher levels, given the impact on gas supply from hotter than normal weather and declines in production.",1
"PSE&G's $12.3 billion base capital investment program over the next five years is focused on ensuring continued reliability and on anticipating, preparing for, and recovering from high-impact, low-frequency events.",0
This compares to non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.36 per share and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $409 million for the first quarter of 2016.,0
The impact on realized energy prices in the first quarter of 2017 reflected a larger decline than the average for the year contributing to the $0.09 per share impact from re-contracting I mentioned earlier.,-1
"As Ralph said PSEG reported net income for the third quarter of 2017 was $0.78 per share, versus net income of $0.64 per share in last year's third quarter.",1
"Our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as our non-GAAP operating earnings measure, as well as income tax expense, interest expense and depreciation and amortization.",0
"During the quarter, non-GAAP operating earnings comparisons increase to $0.01 per share as a result of higher capacity prices in New England and PJM.",1
"The nuclear plants run at full power, providing base load capacity for everyday demand as the shortage of natural gas required some power stations to operate on oil.",-1
Growth in PSE&G's investment in transmission improved quarter-over-quarter net income comparisons by $0.03 per share and recovery in investment made in gas distribution under PSE&G's Energy Strong and Gas System Modernization programs increased quarter-over-quarter net income by $0.01 per share.,1
"The filing is based on a test year ending June 30, 2018 with some adjustments for the following months including a rate base of $9.6 billion as of December 31, 2018.",0
"PSE&G's filing took into account approximately $130 million reduction in its annual revenue requirement as a result of the federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%, and in addition, provides for a onetime credit for estimated excess income tax collected from January 1, 2018 to the time rates go into effect.",0
And for the year-to-date period Power's nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 92.9% producing 15.8 terawatt hours and representing 63% of Power's total generation.,0
"Finally, I'll just say that 88% of our financial debt is at a fixed rate to maturity, mostly in euros, rather than other currencies.",0
"For the RE group, the international business transaction carried out in 2015 represents an important milestone for the Red El√©ctrica group and the execution of its 2014-2019 strategy plan since they significantly expand the group's presence in South America into adjacent geographic regions in the north of Chile and the south of Peru.",-1
"However, in recent weeks, we have seen a further dramatic drop in commodity prices, which puts many of our power plants in an unsustainable position.",-1
"Besides the operational problems, lower energy consumption of customers, the shift from standard to non-standard rate tariff and higher customer losses are also factors for the lower results.",-1
"As mentioned at our Credit Day in September, it is important to see that the German Government follows the aim to maintain the economic performance of utilities in the context of the nuclear phase-out and its subsequent costs.",0
"This will very much depend on the technical, economical and regulatory aspects, which will be determined over the next few months.",0
"As in the recent conference calls, I will concentrate on the most important topics to leave as much time as possible for your questions.",0

"We're in ‚Äì we are in advanced discussions with multiple office users to fully pre-lease the 540,000 square foot office component of the entitlement.",0
"Net absorption was 8.7 million feet for the third quarter and the vacancy rate was flat to last quarter, but improved 30 basis points from a year ago.",1
"We have five floors under leased negotiation, which is a ‚Äì what our expectation was for the year and hope to have all of these leases signed by year-end.",0
If you assume a $500 million debt issuance at the beginning of 2017 and we will reduce our 2017 earnings guidance by about $0.05 a share.,-1
"In Boston, 45% interest in the Vertex building, two assets comprising 1.1 million square feet located in the Seaport District sold for $158,000 a square foot and a 4.3% cap rate to a sovereign wealth fund.",0
"The remaining $0.03 was comprised of $0.02 per share of earlier than projected leasing, primarily in Boston and San Francisco.",0
I've truncated my comments this morning since we provided you with a pretty robust view of the portfolio at the conference less than 30 days ago.,0
"In summary, and most importantly, our portfolio continues to generate growth, and we are projecting strong external growth from our developments.",1
"This has in fact happened, we took it back on the 31st of December, we have signed a lease, we've re-let 90,000 square feet of 105,000 square foot block, the roll up on the 90,000 square feet is 122% on a net basis that'll hit our statistics in next quarter.",1
"C. during the first week of January, 500 E Street was built in the 1980s and it was one of the first buildings we developed in Washington We had recently extended the anchor GSA lease with a long term flat extension.",0
"After accounting for the reduction in earnings from asset sales, we're increasing our guidance at the midpoint by $0.07 per share for FFO.",1
"The site is also directly adjacent to the future Reston Town Center Metro Station, anticipated to open in 2020, which will connect Reston via the Silver Line to both Washington DC and Dallas Airport.",0
"Boston Properties will assume operational control of the codevelopment, and construction of the foundation for the tower is already under way.",0
"We can accomplish our growth plan without accessing public equity capital given the debt capacity and deliver developments and, if needed, access to plentiful private equity capital.",1
Rent growth in older towers which were traditional build-outs are also higher but at rates that are still lower than the new construction inventory is a great value.,1
"And also as identified on page 32 of our supplemental package, several other elements of our land management program are progressing on track with the objective of achieving our overall land monetization goals.",1
"So we will expect to exceed our original target yield and wind up at about 7.7%, exceeding our original target of 7%.",1
"We're confident that as the steel rises out of the ground and the  build-to-me (6:12) comes more definable on the skyline, we will replicate the leasing success we had with our other university city projects.",1
These efforts ensured our 2014 business plan metrics were achieved and have set the path for a continued progression as of the end of 2015.,1
"To wrap up our prepared remarks, 2014 was an outstanding year for our company, great execution on operations, investments, and balance sheet management with all trend lines moving in the right direction.",1
"We believe these sales transactions, the development pipeline and our operating performance do put us on track to achieve our long-term target of debt to GAV in the low 30% range and an EBITDA of around 6 times in the next six quarters to eight quarters.",1
"Headlines of our 2017 plan reflect an 8.5% increase in year-over-year FFO growth and a 11.9% increase in cash flow growth, a midpoint 7% cash same-store growth rate, improving occupancy, declining average capital cost and an investment plan that reflects the 2016 completion of our portfolio repositioning efforts.",1
Our speculative revenue plan is 90% complete on a revenue basis and 80% complete on a square footage basis which compares favorably to our performance in 2016.,1
"As outlined previously, while the same-store NOI will benefit from the renewal of IBM, the GAAP NOI will actually decrease.",1
"As a reminder, we anticipate recognizing our fifth and final installment of an historical tax credit income during the third quarter, totaling approximately $11.9 million or $0.07 a share.",0
"Looking at our capital plan for the second half of the year, we project CAD to be between a range of $0.80 to $0.90, with reflecting about $20 million of revenue maintaining CapEx for the balance of the year.",0
"Our 2014 plan does not project any additional development starts, but that situation could change as financial partners are lined up and/or additional leasing occurs.",1
"Looking at the investment market, during 2013, there was a great deal of capital chasing core assets in gateway markets, and we expect that, that will continue into 2014.",1
"FFO contribution from our unconsolidated joint ventures should approximate $9.5 million, and we predict that our joint ventures will contribute about $37 million for the year.",0
"But with FMC coming online and the other strong portfolio metrics, we felt we created the earnings momentum to accelerate the sales while still posting earnings and CAD growth.",1
"We also refinanced $87 million of secured debt by extending the maturity by four years, and lowering the rate from 7.6%, down to slightly below 4%.",0
"The Greater Philadelphia region's overall outlook remains encouraging, unemployment declined in the first quarter to 4.8%, down 100 basis points year-over-year, positive absorption occurred for the fourth consecutive quarter and the city continues to see an influx of tenants from suburban locations.",1
"So, yes, retail sales are down, but in a tough, tough market, we're 130 basis points ahead of the index and our footfall is positive.",1
"I'm pleased to say we further reduced our weighted average interest rate and today it stands at 3.6%, down 20 basis points in the half.",1
"We invested around ¬£750 million at an average yield of 5.4%, mainly by increasing our share in assets we already know and like.",1
"We generated ¬£800 million of profit so far on ¬£1 billion of capital employed, but equally important is the work we've done to rebuild our development pipeline.",0
"So, bringing that all together, you can see that profits are up 6.6% and our fees and administrative costs are in line with last year.",1
"Have increased those profits by, first of all, achieving high levels of pre-lets and Lucinda has talked about the 56% of pre-lets, all on accretive terms.",1
"We accept and often welcome turnover on anchor boxes as it gives us the ability to position this space for the best use, uses that will improve and often transform the center's rent growth opportunity.",1
Taking the proactive step of gaining control via the bankruptcy auction process now gives us the opportunity to reposition these assets as we want to.,1
"The implementation of property standards and scorecards has substantially increased the appearance of our centers and, as we highlighted at Investor Day, built significant goodwill with our tenants.",1
"We are seeing the impact of our efforts in our grocery sales, which have climbed to a strong $537 per square foot.",1
I do encourage you to explore the slide deck we posted last time on our website that illustrates our continued progress in upgrading our centers.,1
"In addition, the impact of 2017 and 2018 bankruptcy activity will moderate in the second half of the year even when taking into account the impact of Toys""R""Us store closures due to both the timing of 2017 bankruptcy activity as well as anticipated rent commencements for backfills of several former H.",-1
"With the growth of these uses, we have proven successful at profitably and proactively reducing our exposure to weaker concepts.",1
"Overall, demand for apartments should continue given the strength of the Dallas economy, but revenue growth will moderate during 2017 as new supply hits the market.",1
"We currently anticipate 2016 full-year FFO to be between $4.50 and $4.60, same-store revenue growth between 3.85% and 4.35%, expense growth between 3.5% and 4%, and NOI growth between 4% and 4.5%.",1
"The composition of our remaining 2013 capital activity depends upon a variety of factors, including capital market conditions at the time we go to market.",0
"Last night we reported funds from operations for the third quarter of 2014 of $98.7 million or $1.09 per share, representing an approximate $3 million or $0.03 per share outperformance to the mid-point of our prior guidance range.",0
"We now have the flexibility to bring forward the land for selective development across various uses through the introduction of third-party capital, create a new and vibrant part of the city, in line with the vision that the Mayor set out in that new London Plan.",1
"And this, combined with the average pricing allows us to confidently plan the broader Earls Court project from a very sound benchmark.",0
"As a reminder, 74 leases have been agreed in the last 12 months at an average of 11% over the December 2014 ERV.",0
"While I won't go through the full list, it's worthwhile to note that our Tier 3 NOI is now just 7% of total mall NOI compared with 22% when we started on this path, and it will continue to decline.",0
"Renewal leasing, in particular, showed improved results with an increase of 15.5% as we converted a number of below market deals to full rents.",1
We are also working on a contract for the sale of a community center and expect to have that executed this week.,0
These 23 leases represented 450 basis points of the decline in renewals and 420 basis points of the overall decline.,-1
"Sales for the second quarter were flat and improvement over the declines we experienced earlier this year, with most border markets posting increases following the rally in the peso.",1
We're moving forward with ROIs from retailers on two locations and are working with the department store to replace the third location.,0
We had over $700 million available on our lines of credit at year-end and have multiple sources of financing available at both the property and corporate level.,0
"As a result of these initiatives, the occupancy at Northgate has increased from 71% at year-end 2013 to 96% at the end of 2015.",1
"As mentioned in our earnings release, we were unable to reach an agreement with a special servicer to modify and extend the loan secured by Acadiana Mall in Lafayette, Louisiana.",-1
"During the quarter, we started construction on a 46,000-square-foot exterior expansion that will allow us to accommodate a number of retailers that are in demand by the market.",0
We're pleased with the positive results from our redevelopment and expansion program and we'll continue to prioritize it throughout our portfolio.,1
"While we understand the ongoing concerns in the market and we are keeping a close eye on their performance, we believe our risk is more than manageable.",-1
"The central elements of our strategy include leveraging our local market, boots on the ground expertise regarding the markets in which we operate, utilizing a well constructed process that combines thorough financial analysis, collaboration between various departments with prompt decision-making; focus on anchor upgrades in connection with redevelopment and re-tenanting projects, and communicating early and often with existing tenants prior to lease expiration to drive successful results.",1
"Lastly, the results of continuing to use the capital embedded in our lower-density market shopping centers to fund our high-density market redevelopment projects is that we are gradually ending up with a portfolio of newly renovated and re-merchandised mixed-use assets concentrated in the premier, high-density submarkets of the northeast.",1
"Although our intention is to not necessarily be in the market every day selling stock, we do think this is another attractive and low-cost arrow in our capital alternatives' quiver when utilized appropriately.",1
"The facility consists of a three-year $260 million revolver that has two one-year extension options, a five-year $50 million term loan, and is initially priced at LIBOR plus 195 basis points.",0
Both of these figures were in line with our expectations and full-year 2018 guidance discussed in our last earnings call.,1
"Excluding these four boxes, occupancy increases 220 basis points and lease percentage increases 200 basis points to 92.5% and 93.2% respectively.",1
"Due to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed in the company's most recent Form 10-K and other periodic filings with the SEC, forward-looking statements speak only as the date of this call, February 25, 2014, and the company undertakes no duty to update them.",0
"We have identified through portfolio wide reviews, specific tenant sectors that we consider low growth and view as out of favor and has begun to slowly replace these expiring spaces with new high-quality tenants in growth sectors such as the Health and Fitness category, fast casual restaurants and Dollar Stores.",-1
"We have gone from an excess of 9 times in 2011 to 8.4 times at the end of 2012, 7.9 times at the end of 2013, and 7.5 times upon the completion of this equity offering.",0
"As a matter of practice, we are constantly mining the portfolio for improvements and upgrades in rents and tenant quality, particularly in the junior anchor and anchor space because these tenants typically drive small shop tenancies and occupancy gains.",1
"One, effective execution of redevelopments already in our pipeline with a particular focus on maximizing returns; two, identifying new accretive redevelopments within our existing portfolio; three, creating holistic and tactical leasing and merchandising strategies for each asset to improve overall performance; and four, evaluating skill sets and streamlining operations for more effective deployment of our human and financial capital.",1
"The total portfolio was 89% occupied and 91.2% leased as of March 31, with a lease to occupied spread of 220 basis points.",0
"I am also joined, as always, by Phil Mays, our CFO; Mike Winters, who was recently bestowed the well-deserved title of Chief Investment Officer; Charles Burkert, our Head of Construction and Development; and Adina Storch, our General Counsel.",0
"The majority of new leasing for the quarter was completed within first quartile assets, reaffirming the importance of the company's strategy to recycle capital out of lower quartile assets and into denser, high-quality assets.",0
"At acquisition, we saw the opportunity to purchase the stability of the in-place lease through 2021 and to provide ourselves sufficient time to create  options (00:06:08) for the underutilized space.",1
"Intellicenter will benefit from very little capital required, low market rent and a healthy NOI yield that will escalate over time.",-1
"Our momentum carried over to the third quarter, and we announced this morning that Granite 190 is under contract at Dallas, Texas.",0
"Additionally, we have $10.1 million of restricted cash that is available to fund future TIs, health fees and capital projects.",0
"The existing portfolio is tracking slightly ahead of budget, primarily due to lower operating expenses, as R&M expenses in particular were lower than budget, which we expect are timing differences, which will even out by the end of the year.",1
"So it shows that we have a rather granular portfolio and this is really a strategy that we like to invest in either small or medium-sized buildings and we try to stay away from too large building complexes, because we find that there is a high-risk concentration at the end of the lease.",0
"In the capital markets, we have capital increase with the presentation of a number of projects the pipeline for the years 2015 to 2017, and so this conference will not bring very new ideas or facts to you except, of course, that it contains the results for the first half.",0
"Thanks to this refinancing of ‚Ç¨270 million, we have now, on page 19, ‚Ç¨462 million (sic) ‚Ç¨562 million available credit lines which will of course cover the short-term CP program, but also cover the pipeline and the debt maturities of the coming months and years.",-1
"At the end of March this year, we also delivered the construction works of the Belliard 40 office building in the heart of the European district of Brussels.",0
"Let's discuss some of our recent leasing activity, which demonstrates the appeal of our well-located unique assets in our key CBD submarkets.",1
"We have also bid on a number of buildings in both Boston and West LA over the past several months, but they priced beyond our underwriting.",0
"If we can't find assets to buy, we're willing to hold cash or lower leverage to enable us to act later and we'll also buy stock as long as the pricing stays attractive.",1
We've completed substantial improvement to this asset and it is competing well with the newest trophy buildings in the city in terms of rate and leasing pace.,1
I will also discuss our preparations for key lease expirations over the next three years as well as leasing progress on our recent acquisitions.,1
"At PSE&G at 80 Park in Newark will give back 137,000 square feet of their total 961,000 feet next September.",0
"The remaining 22.5% interest gets triggered at the earlier of one year ‚Äì from a one year anniversary, which would be July of 2018 or when we as a partnership have identified at least $600 million more in acquisitions.",0
"229 West 43rd, a fully leased property with substantial average lease term, provides the ballast to our two value-add properties so we're replicating when it's worked with such success in San Francisco by assembling a mix of stabilized properties with near-term lease up opportunities.",1
We have three more dispositions left to complete and we are working hard to get those done with the most attractive pricing and in the appropriate timeframe.,1
"As we noted in our updated guidance for the fourth quarter, this delay combined with NYU lease, starting the first this month, has temporarily boosted our FFO for the year.",-1
"While this timing may result in a somewhat reduced pace of sales for us in the first half of 2014 relative to past years in Virginia, we will continue to drive sales in the remaining capacity of VA1.",0
"Our third quarter FFO was $0.47 per diluted share and unit, an increase of 4.4% on a sequential quarter basis and a 17.5% increase year-over-year.",1
This customer is utilizing its collocation space with us to support multiple applications that require low latency and interconnection density combined with a reasonable total cost of ownership.,0
"As Paul mentioned, Q3 leasing was again heavily weighted towards expansions of existing customers, which continues to be a strong source of organic growth for us in existing deployments and in new markets or facilities.",1
"Turning to the cloud vertical, as I mentioned previously, we saw good growth from existing cloud customers that expanded with us in Q3 to support growth in their respective products and services.",1
"For 2017, we continue to expect the percentage of interest capitalized to be in the range of 10% to 15%.",0
"Third, we believe we have materially increased the number of new and expansion executions for what we identify as strategic deployments, customer applications that we believe disproportionately attract other applications and increase the value of our platform.",1
"In our cloud vertical, we won two expansion deals with Intermedia and Layered Tech, while in our enterprise vertical, we won a significant new private and public cloud deployment with Samsung SDS relative to its IT infrastructure.",0
"The Open Cloud Exchange enables customers to take advantage of secure, performance-optimized connections to cloud service providers of their choice and leverage various networks across the country as on-ramps to the cloud.",1
Our G&A expenses were lower compared to the prior quarter and below our previous guidance of approximately 12% of revenue.,1
"These expenditures were in line with what we discussed during our February 2012 conference call and are comprised of $5 million to bring certain data centers up to brand and improve efficiencies, $10 million related to office building improvements, primarily at SV1, where we remodeled our lobby and added mezzanine office space.",1
"We now expect total operating revenue to be in the range of $392.5 million to $402.5 million, compared to the previous range of $391 million to $401 million.",0
"We are now under construction at VA2 to convert the remaining 96,000 square feet of shelf space into TKD capacity, which we expect to complete in the first quarter of 2016.",0
"Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, we entered into a new five-year $100 million term loan, by exercising a portion of the accordion under our $500 million senior unsecured credit facility.",0
"Going forward, we will expect interconnection volume to continue to show strong growth as we further build network density across our operating portfolio.",1
"With that landscape surrounding our capital priorities laid out, I'll take a moment to offer insight into our leasing objectives for 2015.",0
"Churn in the fourth quarter was 1.4%, bringing the full year rate to 5.6% or 1.4% on average per quarter, which is also in line with our guidance range.",0
"First, on page 14, we have updated the layout of the operating properties table to provide a more comprehensive overview of the total data center portfolio by including pre-stabilized and total data center square footage and occupancy.",0
"We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained.",0
"Our sales total is comprised of 103,000 net rentable square feet at an average GAAP rate of $219 per square foot.",0
"Regarding our vertical mix, during Q1, network and cloud customers signed 56 new and expansion leases, representing 47% of our total.",0
"Importantly, approximately 94% of our GAAP backlog relates to leases, which will commence once construction is complete, reflecting a significant amount of preleasing.",0
"As of the end of the first quarter, we had invested $40 million of the estimated $131 million required to complete these projects.",0
"Regarding New York, Phase I of our NY2 facility consisting of the first three computer rooms brought to market is now 19% occupied and 30% leased.",0
"Our digital content vertical was strong again in Q3, representing 20% of leases signed and 50% of annualized GAAP rent.",1
"Specifically, in total, we believe that we have the ability to more than double the amount of sold net rentable square footage in our portfolio solely from land and buildings we currently own, and in aggregate, at a cost basis that we believe will be highly attractive.",1
"Consistent with our guidance, these three leases decreased cash rent spreads, which rolled down 11.9% in the third quarter and 5.7% for the nine months.",-1
"After the free-rent burns off, our same office cash NOI growth will be 3% or higher, driven primarily by rent increases and modest occupancy gains.",1
"Demand from contractors was in a healthy recovery throughout the year, and we are encouraged by the increase in activity we have seen in the fourth quarter.",1
"Anticipated non-renewals between now and the end of 2016 total 1.3 million square feet, which equates to an average of 650,000 square feet a year, and is consistent with the leasing challenges we handled in 2014.",-1
"NOI gains from placing DC-21 into service and recent occupancy gains in our operating portfolio, partially offset by higher-than-expected property level expenses scheduled for the fourth quarter, account for a more modest increase versus third quarter results.",1
The 2016 business plan which we first discussed in December is very simple and has three parts: deliver same office cash NOI growth of 3% or more; grow externally through low-risk development; and sell at least $400 million of lower growth assets in order to fund development and achieve our balance sheet goals.,1
"We executed 63,000 square feet of leases at the former aerospace building in Westfields, taking that property from 0% leased at the beginning of the fourth quarter to 43% leased at the end of the quarter.",0
We are in the process of refinancing it with a new secured loan and expect to have that completed in April.,-1
Our higher fourth quarter also increases full year FFO per share guidance as adjusted for comparability to the range of $1.96 to $1.98.,1
High profile mixed-used developments are close to commencing on three of the most valuable available land sites on Light and Pratt Streets.,1
The sales we have under LOI or contract will improve our leverage and credit metrics to levels that are more comparable with our long-term balance sheet goals and the planned sales of approximately $200 million in 2016 will fund next year's development investment.,1
"Looking forward to 2017, Cousins is well positioned to execute with a critical mass of urban trophy office assets located in some of the most fundamentally attractive markets in the Sun Belt.",1
This was caused by a sharp increase in our long term incentive compensation accrual which was driven by a strong recent share price performance.,-1
"We are confident in our team's ability to backfill this space in coming quarters, as economic fundamentals remain very positive with Orlando continuing to be a leader nationally with job growth of approximately 4.4%.",1
Much of it as a result of the rapid growth at Georgia State and the students on the street as well as a significant private and public investment in and around Centennial Park.,1
"While ACSC has been relatively slow over the last few years, we are seeing renewed incredible interest from additional datacenter users who value the large floorplates and main fiber line that runs through downtown Atlanta.",-1
The market is benefiting from employment growth that is double the national average and is projected to be one of the top four markets for office using employment growth in the nation over the next two years.,1
"Before starting, I want to remind everyone that we only provide data for specific property assets where historical performance may not exist or may not be a reasonable guidepost for future performance.",0
"Switching gears, the biggest Cousins' news during the second quarter was our announced transaction with Parkway Properties, where we will merge the operations of our two companies and simultaneously spin-off the operations of our combined Houston portfolios into a separate publicly traded REIT.",0
I will wrap up my section of the call by providing detail on our updated earnings guidance as well as some color on our same property performance.,1
"Year-to-date, Atlanta has absorbed about 1.5 million square feet of office space and job growth has been 2.5% over the past 12 months.",1
We have started to pre-market this space and plan to begin construction on a full lobby renovation later this year.,0
"Switching gears to the development pipeline, we are thrilled to be working with NCR, the global leader in consumer transaction technologies to build their world headquarters in Tech Square area of Midtown Atlanta.",0
"In addition to the new lease with Parsley Energy at 300 Colorado in Austin, we filled vacancies across the portfolio, while completing some key renewals and expansions.",1
Leasing momentum hit another all-time high for the second year in a row as we completed approximately 3 million square feet of new and renewal leases.,0
Second generation office rents were up 14.1% on a cash basis for the quarter and our same-property office portfolio finished 92% leased.,1
"While we not have specifics to share at this time, we continue to believe that the likely outcome is a long-term extension as the Bank views this particular space at Gateway Village as mission critical to their operation.",-1
"I'll start with our most recent development announcement 10000 Avalon, our second office building in the highly successful Avalon mixed-use development in North Atlanta.",1
And the portfolio is really good in terms of positioning because it is in prime location in Berlin and it's more upscale hotel.,1
"And if you look at office spaces as an investment market, which is particularly dynamic with a clear inflow of capital to our markets and office space in France, but also Residential real estate in Germany where the investment market is extremely dynamic.",0
"Now our leases too ‚Äì long duration of our leases is something we  really (8:05) work, where we try to major customers and have some security in leases, six years firm for our leases, and very staggered renewals in the future, basically in the locations that we chose, nearly 90% are in French Offices, 85% in Offices in Italy and a very high figure in German Residential space too.",0
"Christophe said that this is partly due to indexing and  they were quick down (38:50) on rentals in 2014, also excellent momentum in residential property in Germany particularly in Berlin and also in hospitality.",1
And these dynamic will continue in 2017 with the focus on largest European cities and we have to-date close to ‚Ç¨800 million of deals already secured.,0
This is a transaction that represents an investment amount of 96 ‚Äì that will generate ‚Ç¨6.7 million in rental income once it's completed.,0
"And of course, we're going to continue to dispose of the residential assets in France, which FDR accounts to about ‚Ç¨600 million in active, very low returns and possible disposal CGs because these are block values, all this with the idea that all these non-core activities will disappear from our balance sheet by 2016 so that we can be 100% focused on core activities by that time horizon.",1
We have a strong presence with data centers situated across the country that align with the higher demand markets and meet the location-specific requirements of our customers.,1
"Based on the anticipated phasing for leases signed in the quarter, we estimate approximately half of this revenue will be recognized in 2016 with the full $44 million recognized in 2017, which will position us really well for continued growth into 2017.",1
"As Gary highlighted, in the third quarter, we brought capacity online in our top markets where we were essentially out of inventory as we were going into this year.",1
Our sales team has booked another record quarter of contracts and the construction and ops teams continue to build and operate at breakneck speeds.,1
"This partnership is not just on the initial deployment into our data center, but also on their future IQ roadmap.",0
We are currently working through financing alternatives as we intend to finance this transaction in a matter that first and foremost takes into account accretion to our shareholders but also credit rating considerations and balance sheet flexibility.,0
An example of a work area recovery client is the large financial services company that uses the space as a backup training floor in case of emergencies.,0
"We have a broad domestic footprint with data centers in major markets across the country, providing an attractive, comprehensive solution for our customers.",1
Slide 16 shows a market-level snapshot of our portfolio as of the end of the second quarter in 2015 and 2014.,0
"As I mentioned earlier, we delivered approximately 92,000 square feet of raised floor and 6 megawatts of power capacity in the second quarter with data halls at our Carrollton facility in Dallas and our Phoenix 2 facility coming online.",0
"Also supportive of our strategy to grow our Fortune 1000 customer base and enhancing the geographic diversity of our portfolio, we plan to expand into two new markets in 2014 including Northern Virginia as well as another location which we expect to be in a position to announce in the coming months.",1
"In closing, we are very pleased with the performance in 2013 with record leasing or record number of customer additions and strong demand for our IX product, all of which drove strong organic growth in revenue, EBITDA and FFO.",1
We have positioned the company to sustain our momentum with the development pipeline to meet the demand we are seeing across our markets and have substantial liquidity to fund our growth.,1
"To highlight these trends, I thought it would be helpful to review the yield trends on three representative properties in our portfolio.",0
"In 2015, we anticipate construction or the purchase of 300,000 square feet to 400,000 square feet of powered shell in our Austin, Northern Virginia and Phoenix markets.",0
"And similar to the success we've had in implementing lease escalators across our contracts, we expect similar success in the launch of this additional price escalator.",1
"In Northern Virginia, we completely sold out the first phases of Sterling and are currently working on delivering the final phase of 15 megawatts, which is 100% pre-sold and will be completed by the first quarter of 2017.",0
"In addition, having a fully occupied and operational facility in a market is strategically very important from a sales and marketing perspective as it provides customers with comfort that CyrusOne can successfully design, build, and operate an enterprise data center in a particular region.",1
We continue to sell well above our respective market share and our bookings for the year were equivalent to 18% of our base revenue which will continue to propel our growth into 2018 and beyond.,1

So let me start here and turn the call over to Keith to provide some deeper results ‚Äì deeper details and results for the quarter.,-1
Currency volatility against all of our operating currencies continues to cause significant FX headwinds this quarter and meaningfully affected our 2015 guidance.,-1
Adjusted EBITDA on normalized and constant currency basis was up 9% over the last quarter and 34% over the same quarter last year.,1
"Our AFFO guidance, as mentioned previously includes the impact of the Telecity net investment hedge in Q3, but ‚Äì our updated AFFO guidance does not make any assumption for Q4 relating to the net investment hedge for Telecity.",0

"The Verizon assets expand Equinix's total global footprint to 179 IBX data centers across 44 markets, comprising approximately $17 million gross square feet, further expanding our scale and accelerating critical relationships in the government and energy sectors.",1
The Americas region had a solid bookings quarter with ongoing strong outbound production and the highest level interconnection as a percent of revenues of the three regions.,1
"On a normalized basis, AFFO would be greater than $1.331 billion, an $18 million increase compared to the prior guidance demonstrating the continued strength of our operating model.",1

We also purchased our D√ºsseldorf DU1 asset for $16 million and are progressing well additional land purchases in EMEA and the United States.,1
"Meanwhile, our Verizon rise integration efforts are progressing well and we continue to be very pleased with the strategic benefits and the financial value from this transaction.",1
"From MRR per cabinet metric remain firm although down slightly on an FX neutral basis due to
although down slightly on an FX neutral basis to the level of billable cabinet additions, strong sales activity into smaller and lower priced assets effectively our mix, and the timing of large footprint deals.",-1
"Since we last spoke, our business has perform exactly as expected on both revenue and expense during the most active quarter in our history.",0
"So, our teams across the country has done a fabulous job so far this year delivering the goods on all fronts.",1

This loan was set to mature in November 2014 and carried a cash interest rate of 5.88% and a GAAP interest rate of 3.45% and the GAAP rate is lower because it's impacted by the amortization of the Archstone debt premium.,0
"Moving on to G&A, we have given annual G&A guidance of $50 million to $52 million, down from $62 million in 2013.",0
This goes to normalized FFO as David Santee just described has been fueled by our expectation of better than expected growth in our net operating income and that's both in the same-store set and the lease up set offset by about $0.02 per share of additional interest expense as a result of our recent debt deal.,1
There is absolutely no doubt that we continue to enjoy very strong apartment demand across our core markets and David Santee will go into much more detail in just a moment.,1
At 17% of total NOI any improvement in Washington Metro will certainly have a favorable impact on our full year results.,1

"But as we all know, trees don't grow to the sky but our dashboard tell us the fundamentals remain strong where new offers issued through March remain in double digits.",1
"In order to balance our sources and uses, we have included in the guidance a $200 million to $250 million borrowing later in 2016, which we have assumed will be a secured one, and we expect to have the revolver drawn or to have CP outstanding equal to about $300 million.",0
And this was driven by a relatively modest increase in payroll and utilities and an increase of 2.9% in property taxes.,-1
So I will start with the market that we expect to have the most positive impact to our 2018 revenue growth and finish up with New York which will have a negative impact.,1

"However, the renewal rates may be negotiated down as rents have peaked for the portfolio and our loss to lease is 0.2%.",-1
"In Q4, job growth improved in the Essex markets with the three-month trailing average job growth at 1.6%, better than the 1.4% estimate reflected on last quarters S-16.",1

"The tech markets of Seattle and San Jose continue to lead the way with more than 3% job growth during the period, driven by increases in the information sector.",1

"In Fabege, we have calculated the, as EBITDA plus realized changes in value, very few do will make the calculations in that manner in the same business.",0

"And we're lagging a little bit behind in the full year planning, but we're going to step up our investment pace.",-1
And I'm now going to talk about our rental market and as we can see that's been an accelerating development in our areas where we have rental property due to both the growth of Stockholm.,1
"And if you look at transactions, this is also important, we want to grow and increase the potential of our portfolio at any given point in time and when we divest, our aim is to do a good deal and to have ‚Äì to see a profit of at least 10%.",1
We want to have a stronger cash flow and our net asset value in the short and the long term.,1
And we see the rental income increase more than SEK 100 million during that particular period compared to the same period last year in the absolute figures.,1
We believe the costs are a little front-loaded and that the forecast of up to SEK 40 million annually still stands.,1
"Looking at the first one, to strengthen our cash flow in the investment property portfolio, well the rental income is up by SEK190 million.",1
"And we're permanently getting confirmation that we're getting better at taking care of customers, we see in measurements of customer satisfaction, we see in our numbers, and our retention rates are incredibly strong and it's very pleasing to see that you get results when you focus on important elements of the operations.",1
"The average interest rate has risen slightly compared with the year-end, which is down to the fact that we are borrowing less and therefore the derivative cost is being allocated across a smaller volume of loans.",-1
This provides us with security to be able to handle both Q3 project investments and take advantage of new business opportunities.,1
So we think it's a very low risk way to start to be looking and be active in the German market.,0

"The approach in 2017 is to sell the next layer of our bottom continually to the top, if possible, but complete our portfolio retransformation by the end of 2017.",0
"While multifamily represents, relatively, a small portion of Mack-Cali today, you can see from our 2013 and planned 2014 activities, very significant commitments and patterns, committing a tremendous amount of energy effort and capital to the development of multifamily properties, with a comparable acquisition and development pace anticipated for many years to come.",1

"Further, subsequent to quarter end the RiverTrace and Estuary lease ups crossed the 95% leasing threshold and we anticipate The Chase will achieve a similar result in early 2015 as well.",1
"We have experienced positive like-for-like growth and release spreads across the board which not only is the testimony of the year that is now passed, but also keeps a very interesting guidance for what is happening in the future because we clearly see an upward trend, an acceleration in the LfL growth and the release spreads that is now consistent across the three years of history of the company, which goes hand-in-hand with the evolution we are also perceiving in the market and in the Spanish cycle.",1
"And then ‚Ç¨21.2 million were devoted for  (00:27:45)  CapEx all across the portfolio, and ‚Ç¨960 million is the full revaluation of the portfolio during the year.",0

"But still we're fairly relatively well and what is more important in those centers where we are approaching the end of works we are seeing a very significant pickup in sales per square meter, which at the end is what matters for most of our retailers.",0
"Also, we are presenting here and this is our pro forma metric, the EPRA NAV pro forma including Metrovacesa that will be ‚Ç¨10.92 per share.",0
"The company currently operates more than 1.9 million square meters, with a further 450,000 being currently work in progress, which represents approximately twofold the figure that was reported as of end of year 2015.",1
"So we're going through a process that we expect to complete by the end of 2017, and we added three new LEED-certified buildings in this quarter, two golds and one silver, which brings our total to six.",0
FFO results for the first quarter of a $1.25 per share were at the top end of our expectations and represented a record quarterly result.,1
"Occupancy remained strong with quarter end physical occupancy for the entire portfolio at 96.3%, putting us in a good position for the traditionally slower leasing activity during the winter months.",1
"FFO for the quarter was 107.4 million, $1.35 per share and core FFO which excludes certain unusual or non-recurring items was at 104.7 million or $1.32 per share, which was $0.16 per share above the mid-point of our previous guidance.",0
"We incurred $3.4 million of debt extinguishment charges related to these payoffs, but the vast majority of this expense was non-cash write-offs or deferred financing cost.",0
I continue to believe that we'll see some increasing opportunities for redeploying capital on an attractive basis as we've moved later into the cycle.,1
And notably this cap rate is only 30 basis points above the expected stabilize cap rate on the three new properties acquired thus far this year.,1
"As Al recap, our balance sheet is in a very strong position, and we continue to build capacity for future growth.",1
We're increasing our core FFO projection by $0.03 per share at the midpoint to reflect both the strength of the first quarter results and also the offsetting impact of revised transaction volume and timing.,1
"However, if the response to the product remained strong through our busier season, we will have the opportunity to exceed this amount.",1
"First, we expect volatility from the direct accounting to reverse the $0.02 of noncash income over the remainder of the year.",-1

This brings total noncore land sales for the year from three parcels all acquired from Colonial containing 66 acres for total net proceeds of 15.2 million and recorded gains of 2.9 million for the year.,1
"Approximately 4% of the company's gross leasable area consisting of six leases, totaling 438,000 square feet was originally set to expire this fiscal year.",0

"As of the end of the quarter, our capital structure consisted of approximately $501 million in debt, of which $401 million was property level fixed rate mortgage debt, and $100 million were loans payable.",0
We are pleased to discuss our results for the second quarter ended March 31 as we continue to make good progress across multiple fronts.,1
The company remains very focused on continuing to deliver positive results and we look forward to building upon the substantial growth that has been achieved.,1
This compares to core FFO for the same period one year ago of $6.7 million or $0.15 per diluted share.,0
"This increase was due to the additional income related to six properties purchased during fiscal 2014, and eight properties purchased during the first three quarters of fiscal 2015.",1

"As mentioned earlier, subsequent to year-end, we acquired a brand new 122,000 square foot facility in Charleston, South Carolina for $21.9 million.",0
"In terms of the impact on the current year's results, timing of acquisitions is arguably more important than volume and our total of $259 million invested through April at an initial cap rate of near 7%, positions us to deliver another year of solid Core FFO per share growth.",1
"As I mentioned, we did increase our 2018 core FFO guidance by $0.02 per share, implying 5% growth in annual results.",1
"During the first half of 2017, the weighted average outstanding balance on our $650 million bank line was $69 million.",1

The weighted average debt maturity  pro forming (11:26) this recent debt offering and paying off our bank line and paying off the $115 million of debt that comes due next month is right at seven years.,0

"As a comment on the angst around rising interest rates and the impact on NNN, we use almost exclusively fixed rate ten-year debt to finance our business and we have carefully staggered debt maturities.",1
Interest expense was 4.5 times and fixed charge was 3.1 time despite the fact we had a large preferred offering in May.,1
"One interesting detail of our acquisition activity is that the vast majority of the transactions were single property acquisitions throughout the year, many of which are purchased from existing tenants within an average investment per property of only $2.8 million.",1
It is anticipated that the leases signed during the quarter will contribute approximately $1 million to same store NOI in the second half of 2018 or around $2 million on a run rate basis.,0

"C., in early July and have included approximately $110 million gain associated with that transaction in our third quarter results.",1
"And finally, we were very active in underwriting a number of capital transactions this quarter, some of which were eventually priced unattractively, but some projects are still ongoing.",0
We believe net proceeds will go towards a further paydown of debt and/or the opportunistic repurchase of our common stock.,-1
"With that, I'll now ask the operator to provide our listeners with instructions on how we can submit our questions.",0
"Despite the loss of over $50 million in annualized property NOI from these 17 disposed properties, and the loss of income from the two large lease expirations, the mid-point of our guidance is only all 3.5% compared to 2017, while simultaneously strengthening our balance sheet position.",1
"Although there continues to be supply growth in the multifamily sector as a whole, we believe generally that the suburban-oriented type properties that we primarily target are seeing less supplier acceleration than the urban-centric type properties.",1

"Turning to capital deployment, in the fourth quarter, we committed $1.1 billion with $842 million our share in new development starts, building acquisitions and investments in funds and ventures.",0

"An important aspect of our 2013 asset management plan was to have our leasing team focus a critical eye on those tenants whose leases were expiring, with the intent of keeping only those retailers with healthy sales volumes and a progressive business plan.",-1
Roughly $4 million of these borrowings were used to pay off two small mortgage loans on our Hoover Eleven Shopping Center.,0
The ongoing success of our shop leasing program demonstrates that we continue to improve the quality of our shopping center portfolio and that it is a prime contributor to the increase in our core average rent to $12.15 a square foot from $12.04 a foot last quarter and $11.54 at the beginning of 2013.,1
"Thus, for the foreseeable future, redevelopments, re-anchorings and shopping center expansions will be critical elements in our growth plans, as it is the strength of our shopping center locations and the ever-improving quality of our tenant mix, which will ensure that our properties remain the dominant retail focus in our trade areas.",1
"While these property transformations may have a short-term impact on occupancy, we believe it is most important to drive long-term value.",1
"As part of an effort to streamline our decision-making process and further drive the business, we have widened our operating platform to create two integrated portfolio teams.",0

"From a modeling standpoint, we're modeling our dispositions using a mid-year convention with two-thirds of our acquisitions occurring in the first half of the year with a balance in the second half of the year.",0

"Tim, Jonathan, Mike and I understand the strong foundation and inherent opportunities that exists at RPT and have the chance to build a first-class blue chip retail real estate company.",1
"Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.61 for the quarter, a 32.6% increase versus a year ago.",1
"Relative to capital, we're in very good shape as Paul mentioned, there's plenty of dry powder to execute on the acquisitions as they present themselves.",1
"We did that for 67 tenants that produced 83% of our revenue and really did that using 19 different metrics to try and assess the risks that they might represent to our revenue stream in a rising interest rate environment or weak economy and it included rankings on each industry based on that industry and how it operates its margins and the consumer that really they serve, an analysis of concentrations of balance sheet and income statement analysis.",0
"We would continue to have capacity in those buckets, but we view maximum levels at kind of 35% debt, 15% preferred.",0
"If you move another five spots and go to our 20th largest tenant, it represents just 1.3% of revenue, so we're still very well diversified by tenant.",0
"And now I'd like to hand it over to Sumit Roy, our recently appointed Chief Investment Officer whose headed acquisitions for about a year now, to discuss acquisitions.",0

"In conclusion, we remained confident in reaching our 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1 billion and disposition volume between $75 million and $100 million.",1
Our same-store rent increased to 0.4% during the quarter primarily due to the timing of percentage rent increases on a year-over-year basis.,1

"Core FFO excludes the impact of approximately $1.5 million of non-recurring acquisition expenses and about $643,000 of non-recurring legal reimbursements.",0
"Within offices, Winnersh showed a 7.5% increase reflecting the initial bids we'd received at the time the valuation was signed off at the end of June, whereas Slough offices were marked down by 2.4% reflecting the valuers' opinion that the yield premium investors would require for some of the buildings which had shorter lease lengths and were six months closer to the end of the lease would be reflected in the premium that investor would pay for that.",-1
"Strong operational performance, development completions, acquisitions, and interest savings have gone a long way towards offsetting this with the results that earnings per share were 8.3% lower at ¬£0.177.",0
"But in our view, we've gained a much better balance of return and risk profile in the assets that we've acquired.",1
"And you can see from the chart on the right-hand side, that pretty much everything that we have developed speculatively or otherwise up to the end of 2015 has been leased.",1

"As we have highlighted in our press release, demand for space in all of these centers has been exceptional and we expect to be fully leased at opening.",1

I'd just in closing say it's been an incredibly busy summer around here and I would like to acknowledge the efforts of our investment and retail teams and leasing and management and underwriting teams in putting together really a stunning series of transactions on the acquisition and disposition side that we believe set us up for enormous future growth and the profits.,1

This is a remarkable achievement for us and reflective of the power of the innovations we've introduced and the sales process this year.,1
The Diamond Resorts Invitational and the Diamond Resorts Concert Series both immerse our guests in experiences that are unique and further evolve our sales process into an integrated hospitality experience.,0
"During the year, we also returned almost $900 million, or 77% of free cash flow, to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks.",1

"In addition, 2013 included a one-time cash charge of $5 million related to the final settlement of the FLRX litigation.",0

"And looking to this year, I believe the underlying funnel of demand is as strong as any point in the last year.",1
Increases in property taxes driven by one-time favorable expenses last year that we have highlighted on prior calls and increased payroll expense led to the decline in hotel operating margins.,-1
We are receiving orders for new display factories in China and expect this equipment to be installed in the fall.,0
"Looking at our financials, R&D spending as a percentage of R&D plus G&A has increased from 53.3% in Q2 of last year to 57% in Q1 of 2013 and 58.5% in Q2 of 2013.",1

"Meanwhile, we are actively engaged in negotiations to sell up to 45 additional hotels this year, using the same general framework of selling assets, obtaining franchise agreements in return, and securing owner commitments to develop or convert new Extended Stay America hotels.",1
"As this hotel is twice as profitable as our average property, we see this strictly as a timing matter and think the revised timeline may actually have the benefit of allowing us to plan for a 1031 transaction, thereby minimizing tax leakage.",1
We also expect a stronger year of spending by NAND customers as mobility supports big growth demand in the 40% to 50% range and 3D technology is introduced.,1
"To further improve our model, we also reduced EES spending to below
$25 million in Q1, down 40% from the same quarter last year.",1
This reflects our October RevPAR growth of 5.6% and a forecast of 3% to 6% for the remainder of the year.,1
"Last year's third quarter G&A expense of $24.5 million included the $3.4 million in system-wide brand-related costs I mentioned earlier, $3.2 million in IPO costs and $600,000 in non-cash equity-based compensation.",0
These strong market drivers in display have enabled us to book $340 million of new orders in our second fiscal quarter.,1
"Based on current market conditions, the full year run rate interest savings would be approximately $10 million to $14 million.",0
"We ended the quarter with total cash of $248.8 million, composed of $71.9 million in unrestricted cash on hand and $176.9 million of restricted cash.",0
"The decrease in corporate overhead was due primarily to lower personnel expenses from short-term incentive compensation and legal expenses, partially offset by $0.7 million in expense on future growth initiatives related to development in franchising and our expanded corporate sales team.",1
We believe the improved relative value of our offerings versus those of our limited service competitors is not fully reflected in our average daily rates.,1
"And non-GAAP EPS should be in the range of $0.72 to $0.80, the midpoint of which would be up by 124% year-over-year.",1
"For the full year 2018, we now expect comparable system-wide RevPAR growth of 1.0% to 2.75% and adjusted EBITDA of $595 million to $610 million.",1
"We see sustainable strength in our markets as new demand drivers, including IoT, Big Data and AI, layer on top of traditional computing and mobility.",1
"And in Q3, we even saw a slight rebound in sales in the West Coast compared to the second quarter.",1
"Over the same time period, we've also driven significant changes within Applied that have resulted in a larger, less volatile and more resilient business.",-1
Applied's display business has grown nearly $2 billion as compared to 2012 and the best indication of Applied's resilience is our services business.,0
"As we look forward, we continue to focus on a business that is proven and fundamentally strong and our strategic priorities and initiatives remain focused on building upon our three key strengths: the scalability of our business platform and the substantial cash flow we're able to deliver; our operation in the highly desired select service segment, a segment to which guests and hotel developers have migrated, guests for the price value proposition and hotel developers for the high cash-on-cash returns; and the quality and depth of our franchise partners and their continued interest in growing the La Quinta brand.",1
"During the first quarter, we generated $84 million in adjusted EBITDA, as our operating model continued to generate strong cash flow.",1
"In the logic/foundry segment ‚Äì sector, equipment spending in 2015 is expected to be driven by high volume manufacturing investments in the 16-nanometer and 14-nanometer nodes and to a lesser extent on development tools for the 10-nanometer node.",0
"Thank you, Mary Jo, and thanks to everyone for attending our third quarter 2014 results conference call, and for your continued interest in ASM International.",0
As you know one of the primary components of this strategy involves the renovation and repositioning of approximately 50 hotels in our owned portfolio.,0
R&D expenses increased by 2% compared to the fourth quarter and by 18% compared to the first quarter of last year.,-1
"Looking at the breakdown in bookings by customer segment, memory was the largest segment for the first time in the last five quarters.",-1
"So we would like to ask you to please limit your questions to not more than two at a time, so that everybody has a chance to ask a question.",0
Operating profit of ‚Ç¨17.3 million after ‚Ç¨1 million in restructuring charges for those first six months provided an operating margin of 8.3%.,-1
"In addition to these 45 openings, we did have two additional openings very early in January, one on January 5 and another on January 9.",0
"For next year, we expect a clear improvement for the ALD market, driven by continued strength in Logic/Foundry, an increase in the contribution from new 3D NAND applications, and an anticipated recovery in DRAM spending not earlier than mid-2017.",1
"Operating income doubled to ‚Ç¨32.5 million, compared to ‚Ç¨15.8 million in the fourth quarter, with operating margin improving from 12.4% to 21.6%.",1
We also signed 22 new franchise agreements in the quarter which drove net growth in our pipeline to 221 hotels.,1
"Franchise interest remains robust for the La Quinta brand as evidenced by a growing pipeline, including three new central business district properties and two new international markets.",1
This plays to the strengths of ALD as more highly precise and conformal film deposition is required for the critical process steps in leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing.,1
"Finally, as an update on our capital return program, next week, at our 2015 Annual General Shareholders Meeting, shareholders will vote on our proposal to increase our dividend per ordinary share for 2014 by 15% to ‚Ç¨0.70 per share.",1
We're also seeing strong demand on our KrF platform where we boosted the productivity of our XT:860 system further to 250 wafers per hour.,1
"For example, this year, we will be implementing guest facing technologies, such as online check-in and the ability to select a specific room, much as you would do with an airline seat assignment.",0
"In addition to this top line strength, comparable hotel direct operating margin increased 350 basis points to 12.9% primarily as a result of the increased ADR and several hotel operating expense control initiatives that we've implemented.",1
"We will also ship the final two NXE:3300 systems, one before year-end and the other in early 2017, to two different customers such that they may also begin the in-house qualification of EUV for eventual production insertion.",0
"Logic demand continues to be solid as customers ramp 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer nodes while the initial demand for the latter, the 7-nanometer node, is the primary driver behind the significant increase in EUV demand in this year.",1
Q4 net bookings and booked ASPs remained at Q3 levels of ‚Ç¨1.45 billion for 52 systems booked with ASPs at ‚Ç¨28 million.,0
"As mentioned earlier, we expect strength in service and field options revenues to continue, and we expect revenues in this portion of our business to be about ‚Ç¨400 million in Q1, and to strengthen throughout the year.",1
"Alongside our 2014 financial performance, we can also claim significant successes in product development, new product introduction, and product adoption.",-1
"Our free cash flow for the quarter was negative ‚Ç¨65 million, this was expected since we received a significant amount of customer prepayments on orders received in Q4, where free cash flow totaled ‚Ç¨864 million.",0
"In the entertainment segment, growth in our ticketing business drove an 11.2% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter versus 2014.",1
"Corporate general administrative expenses for the fourth quarter were $2 million, a reduction of $260,000 or 11.4% from the prior year period, reflecting our continued focus on disciplined expense management.",1
"At March 31, 2013, we had three assets classified as held for sale on the balance sheet, the Red Lion Hotel Medford, the Red Lion Hotel Pendleton, and the commercial mall in Kalispell.",0
We expect our Q3 installed base management revenue to step up a bit from previous quarters to around ‚Ç¨700 million.,1
"Hotel RL is clearly on the cutting edge and interestingly The Living Stage, another industry-first concept is being emulated by others.",0
"Through this app, we have redefined the inclusive travel process in order to provide a more convenient experience for our guests from booking to checkout.",1
"So that ‚Ç¨30 million is basically at peak level and that will go down in the third quarter, but even more in the fourth quarter, more closely towards and depending of course on the development programs and towards the mid-20s.",-1
"We have the iPhone 3, iPhone 4. iPhone 4s, iPhone 5, iPhone 6, iPhone 7, iPhone 8, and then we've seen the Samsung Galaxy 3, Samsung Galaxy 4, Samsung Galaxy 5, now Samsung Galaxy 6.",0
"I guess that has to do with the Swiss franc as well, but are you indeed also stepping up R&D investments and can we model that going forward?",1
"We will focus our efforts to achieve an improvement in our Franchise business adjusted EBITDA of 15% to 17% by organic franchise growth, a reduction in our cost base and the productive deployment of our cash reserves in capital for the growth of our franchise base.",1
"To begin, our portfolio continued to perform reasonably well in the fourth quarter, ongoing improvements in demand coupled with solid growth from many of our newly acquired and recently renovated hotels, offset by isolated negative events such as the government shutdown and softness in Chicago and New York resulted in moderate top-line growth in the fourth quarter.",-1
"As our hotels have established better base business through groups in contracts, our operators have focused on increasing transient revenue through rates with mix shifting and compression.",1
"Meanwhile, we expect to see continued growth in demand for upper scale hotel rooms across our portfolio as the ongoing rebound in employment, corporate profits and improving consumer and business sentiment continue to fuel high-rated travel, especially in the major U. S. markets where we have hotel investments.",1
"To this end, we're currently working to proactively address our 2015 debt maturities through a refinancing that will capitalize on the currently very low interest rate environment while further extending out and laddering our maturity schedule.",-1
Weakness in certain markets contributed to an increase in discounted room nights of approximately 8% during the first quarter as operators look to fill occupancy.,1
"Following this refinance, our debt has a weighted average term to maturity of approximately 4.1 years and an average interest rate of 4.4%.",0
"Each of these leases will generate a new stream of profitability for the hotel and, importantly, will serve to enhance and complement the overall guest experience of this property.",1
Our Marriott Portland achieved a 19% increase in RevPAR as we employed an aggressive rate strategy following the completion of our rooms renovation earlier in the year.,1
"In fact when taken on a same-store basis, our Q2 occupancy rate was more than three percentage points above the peak Q2 occupancy achieved by the same hotels the last cycle.",1
We expect the momentum from Cloud Data Center demand to sustain and expect a seasonal increase in demand for our Broadband access and set-top box products.,1
"So despite this anticipated sharp correction in hard disk drive year-on-year, we expect this Enterprise Storage segment to show double digit growth.",1
"With the consolidated ownership of the fee and leasehold, we now truly control the asset, which we believe is an important component in determining what long-term relevant real estate is and what it is not.",0
"Because these hotels are not consistent with our strategy of owning long-term relevant real estate, we reduced our expected investment horizon for both hotels, which, combined with the declining operations, led us to record an impairment charge this quarter.",-1
"Today Chuck Swoboda, our Chairman and CEO; and Mike McDevitt, our Interim CFO, will report on our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2013.",0
"I will be providing a commentary on our financial statements on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which is consistent with how management measures Cree's results internally.",0
"Our Q2 effective tax rate was 26% for the quarter, which is higher than the 22% we targeted due to overall higher profitability and a greater portion of our targeted fiscal 2013 earnings being in higher tax jurisdictions.",1
"We continue to target incremental improvement in lighting margins and I'm confident that our focus on service, execution and innovative new products can drive solid revenue growth and deliver improved profits during fiscal 2018.",1
"Furthermore, at the end of January, approximately 75% of our forecasted group room nights for the full year have been identified.",0
"To the extent that the regular quarterly common dividend for 2017 does not satisfy our annual distribution requirements, we would expect to pay a catch-up dividend in early 2018 that would generally be equal to a remaining taxable income.",1
"Non-GAAP earnings exclude $18.6 million of expense, net of tax or $0.15 per diluted share from the amortization of acquired intangibles and stock-based compensation.
Non-GAAP and GAAP earnings per share were on the high end of our revised targeted ranges of $0.31 to $0.36 for non-GAAP and $0.16 to $0.21 for GAAP.",0
"At this time, we target Q3 revenue to be in a range of $395 million to $415 million, which is comprised of: Lighting sales flat to slightly higher sequentially as higher indoor LED fixture sales offset seasonally lower outdoor sales; LED sales down single-digits due to normal seasonality and the Chinese New Year Holiday and Power and RF sales similar to Q2.",-1
"Our non-GAAP earnings exclude $45 million of expense net of tax or $0.44 per diluted share from non-cash stock-based compensation, acquired intangibles amortization, the RF Power acquisition transaction and integration costs and lighting rightsizing cost and other items.",0
"We expect to spend an additional $9 million next year for the guestroom and corridor renovation, as well as approximately $6 million over the next two years, upgrading the existing 65,000 square feet of meeting space.",0
"This increase of  $4 (20:46) million at the midpoint is directly attributable to the reasons we just discussed, as there has been no change to our expectations for interest expense or income tax expense for the year.",1
"Our Q2 GAAP tax rate was 20% and our non-GAAP tax rate was 16%, which was below our 25% target.",0
We are working on a next generation LED platform to further increase price performance and enable the next wave of new lighting application.,1
GAAP earnings increased to $16.1 million or $0.14 per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and non-GAAP earnings increased to $31.8 million or $0.27 per diluted share.,1
The creation of this new suite category will allow the hotel to compete more effectively in both the corporate and association group segments.,1
"We believe this restructuring, once fully completed in our fiscal Q2, will better position the LED business to focus on our new market-leading high-power products with the reduced cost structure going forward.",1
We remain focused on leading with innovative technology to deliver better products and value to our customers and more profits to the bottom line.,1
The opportunity to sell our lowest quality assets in these markets at an attractive valuation relative to our public market value has created additional balance sheet flexibility for us.,1
"While we believe the Lighting ERP implementation issues are mostly behind us, we believe near-term commercial orders will take time to fully recover as we're regaining our customers' confidence.",1
"Our same-property hotel EBITDA margin declined 71 basis points to 29.9%, largely driven by a subset of hotels that experienced significant declines in RevPAR compared to 2015.",-1
"The Westin Galleria and Oaks struggled this quarter on the top-line, with RevPAR down nearly 9%, but we have been successful in implementing numerous cost control strategies, allowing hotel EBITDA to remain virtually flat compared to last year.",-1
"As I mentioned, Houston benefited from post-hurricane demand and our hotels were able to drive rate as a result of strong group business during the quarter.",1
"Napa and Santa Barbara struggled in the fourth quarter as a result of declines in business related to their respective wildfires, each down 13%.",-1
"By year-end, we expect to begin construction on the 25,000 square-foot ballroom with 30,000 square feet of ancillary, pre-function and support space.",0
The beat in the first quarter has been added to our full year guidance and there were no other changes to our RevPAR outlook for the three remaining quarters of 2018.,0
"For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, revenue increased 8% sequentially to a record $436 million, which was within our targeted range of $430 million to $460 million.",1
"Power and RF products revenue grew 4% sequentially to $28.6 million and gross profit grew 4% to $16.3 million for a 56.9% gross margin, which was similar to last quarter and in line with our target.",0
"As part of our strategy to improve our core, we will use these proceeds for investment projects in our core portfolio that we expect will generate high returns.",1
"The term loan was used to repay all of our mortgage debt except for the debt outstanding on Charleston Place, which is a separate non-recourse financing structure consisting of one main facility with a balance of $84 million and two smaller local facilities totaling $12 million.",0
"Today Chuck Swoboda, our Chairman and CEO; and Mike McDevitt, our CFO, will report on our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2014.",0
Our positive engagement with the owner of this property has resulted in us securing an agreement to manage the Durley House luxury apartments under the Belmond Cadogan umbrella.,1
"Same-store owned hotel's RevPAR, which excluded Inn at Perry Cabin, was up 2% year-over-year in both dollars and local currency.",1
"Today, Chuck Swoboda, our Chairman and CEO; and Mike McDevitt, our CFO, will report on our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015.",0
"We target non-GAAP operating expenses to be slightly higher as we fund our IP licensing strategy, and have incremental sales expense associated with the targeted fixture sales growth.",1
Our second priority is to build the Cree brand in both the commercial and consumer lighting segments by expanding our product offerings and continuing to invest in marketing the value of the Cree LED bulb and LED lighting directly to the end user.,0
"46% of our global guest base originates from North America, and we are seeing early signs of increased demand from this important market.",1
"For North America, we are expecting Belmond Charleston Place will have a terrific year as the City of Charleston is seeing strong increases in visitor arrivals; and after full refurbishment, our hotel is perfectly positioned to capture this incremental demand.",1
Winning platform designs with these leading customers allows us to increase the stickiness of our business and extend our design win lifecycles as developers focus on expanding the number of applications derived from the same core designs.,1
This repositioning has allowed our NPD division to achieve three consecutive quarters of growth and we are on track for a fourth in Q3.,1
"Unlike the mobile phone touch business which basically is a no-profit zone for everybody participating, the automotive touch business is long-term, high-quality business and we're still in it.",1
"As part of the management contract, we've committed $3 million of key money to be used for agreed property enhancements.",1
"Dan mentioned what we call MBR, Mechanical Button Replacement, we've already replaced something like five billion buttons which is maybe a fraction of a percent of the buttons on the earth.",0
"We made this change in order to breakdown the silos that previously existed in some of these areas with the goal of creating one seamless customer-centric sales organization that encourages the collaboration of all the revenue-related efforts at the property, at the regional as well as on the corporate levels.",1
We view these games as an enormous opportunity to promote the Belmond brand due to the significant increased guest flow that we will have here both from new guests staying at the hotel as well as from the elevated walk-in traffic that we are expecting here.,1
"In the last two years, among the most valuable things that we have created is an authentic and clearly defined brand identity.",1

"We expect Optimum or CVC leverage to come down rapidly as well from a similar starting point to Suddenlink, it's already down to 6.7 times on a last two-quarter annualized basis at the end of the third quarter, that has returned in just one quarter.",-1
"We believe we are taking the right steps to improve these trends, including expanding our fiber network, which will increase our addressable market, and offering enhanced content bundle.",1
"At the end of June, our outstanding net debt stood at MXN 617 billion, which represents a reduction of MXN 11 billion relative to December, again the Telekom Austria bonds had been considered to be debt at that point.",1
"At constant exchange rates, third quarter total revenues were up 7.5% from the year-earlier quarter and EBITDA nearly flat at minus 0.5%.",1
"Such losses are unrealized losses that accrue on the currency exposure of our debt, which has a 12-year average life, with most of our currency exposure centered in euros.",-1
"So rather than posting the decline of 17.7%, which is due to one-off in last quarter of 2015 and the last quarter of 2016, if you look at the underlying EBITDA growth, it was 1.7%.",1
"In the second quarter, financial volatility in Latin America became more subdued in line with the situation in the global market, with world economic growth on a slightly improving path.",1

"On the 787 program, our backlog consists of approximately 700 firm orders which provide a solid foundation for future production.",0
"So, we do expect savings in the tune of SEK 140 million on an annual basis in this business here, which is obviously good effect here.",1
Global services and support reported revenue of $2.4 billion and generated strong operating margins of 14.9% driven by performance and favorable contract mix.,1
"Key awards including a contract for F-15 sustainable for Cutter, an order for seven 737-800 Boeing converted freighters from G KAS , a 787 landing gear exchange agreement with All Nippon and PAI training agreement for India.",0
"At the same time, the net impact of higher cash tax payments is incorporated, and although we have a benefit from the lower effective tax rate, our cash tax payments will still increase compared to the prior period, as our unit profitability continues to improve on the 787 program.",1
Key commercial milestones in the quarter included the delivery of the first 787-10 Dreamliner to Singapore Airlines and the first 737 MAX 9 to Lion Air group.,0
"Revenue in the second quarter was $24.3 billion, reflecting higher volume of commercial deliveries and favorable mix, along with services and defense contract volume.",1

"We are mainly maintenance and rebuild dependent, but also there, the clients who are under pressure themselves try to reduce their cost and that translates into pressure that we are feeling.",-1
"Under this principle, the order backlog will reflect the minimum future revenue to be recognized on the contracts, not the list price as it does today.",0
The sharp decrease in order backlog mentioned earlier will have an impact on the volume development going forward and therefore also additional restructuring might be possible in 2017.,-1
"There's no doubt in our mind, even with fewer than 30 aircraft that we originally said were necessary to reach breakeven point.",-1

"On the cash evolution page 9, the cash flow from operations of ‚Ç¨206 million is roughly in line with our EBIT adjusted.",0

"And, well, so my last line, I say thanks to the portfolio, our growing top line and the focus on managing risks and costs.",1
"With regard to EBITA, in November, when confirming our breakeven guidance for EBITA adjusted, we mentioned that we need a flawless execution and a strong operating performance in the fourth quarter.",1
"That will continue throughout early 2018, and it forms part of the increased expenditure that Klaus mentioned, as part of the ‚Ç¨20 million, getting in the right  kind of (00:38:07) expertise to industry profile, the credibility and credentials that we need in order to pitch at the right level with high-level customers.",1

"Our wide range of EPS guidance is primarily attributable to the timing of our first AECOM Capital monetization, which has the potential to close in either this fiscal year or next.",0

"Over the past year, voter supported more than $200 billion of infrastructure ballot measures, including substantial initiatives in Los Angeles and Seattle, FAST Act funding has increased, several states have raised gas taxes to fund transportation investment, and California signed into law over $50 billion of incremental transportation funding.",1
The group business performance was substantially in line with or better than our expectation in almost all sectors with the exception for Defense Electronics and Security where Selex improved but DRS were adversely affected not only by the expected fall in volumes but also by unforeseen technical issue in a specific air cargo handling contract.,-1
We are well ahead of our target to return at least 50% of our free cash flow to investors during fiscal 2013 and 2014 and we have $426 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization.,1
"Over the last 12 months, we have made four strategic acquisitions that bolstered our presence in Africa, Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia and also added construction services and multi-discipline engineering capabilities.",1
This is the kind of differentiation that will allow AECOM to grow faster than the competition and earn higher margins.,1
You see that the DRS performance today is fully satisfactory with respect ‚Äì even keeping into account the significant reduction in revenues.,1
Abundant energy supply and lower prices will create long-term advantages for our domestic business which accounts for nearly two-thirds of our company.,1

Restructuring costs are down in the first half and this contributes roughly 20 basis points to the EBIT margin increase.,1
"The opportunities for us will largely be in the heavy oils like we do in Canada with the oil sands, as well as the unconventional gas and onshore gas globally.",1
"The markets that we are chasing haven‚Äôt changed much, oil and gas, mining, infrastructure, and another kind of niche additions to our business and of course anytime we can add a four client, that‚Äôs important.",0
"Profitability benefited from the strong revenue growth with EBIT reaching ‚Ç¨374 million, 10.3% of sales thanks to this favorable volume impact, saving from structure costs and also lower restructuring.",1
"Its contribution to our EBIT was above our expectations, but you must keep in mind that like in 2015, 2016 results included some positive one-off items.",1
"With respect to profitability, the target that we set in 2014 was to improve by 1.5 to 2 points our EBIT margin, using the 8% we achieved in 2013 as a base.",1
"On all the three pillars of our strategy, we are leveraging a rich set of initiatives, addressing both the short term and the long term.",0
"So overall, I have to say that I'm extremely optimistic about this marketplace, I know it's strong, it's not going to like the , but it is going to be strong steady growth as we go through the rest of the year and I think into following years as well.",1
"And our free operating cash flow performance was exceptionally strong, ‚Ç¨1,365 million, benefited on top of our financial performance from good control of CapEx and strong WCR performance.",1
"However, thanks to the gradual phasing out of these contracts and our transformation efforts, we expect this business to keep increasing its profitability in 2018 and in 2019 to get back to its historical level.",1
"As a result, we have taken additional actions to mitigate the impact of the short fall, by instituting a formal restructuring program that is meant to further realign and simplify our business, resulting in reduced cost and increases in our simplicity and alignment in the organization.",1
"So that's really all I wanted to say about the industrial factor, but I obviously want to spend a little bit more time about our public and institutional business.",0
"We are also beginning to see momentum develop against our restructuring effort, which will drive more substantive cost savings in the future.",-1
"The Nacelles business also are showing high growth rate driven by sales of spare parts, especially for new A320neo customers and our MRO activities for landing gear also contributed to this very good growth.",1

"On an adjusted basis, SG&A fell $14 million versus the year ago period continuing the positive signs of our success to drive greater cost efficiency.",1
"So, higher than previously anticipated operating earnings, a modestly lower tax rate, and a lower share count permits us to increase our EPS guidance for continuing operations to between $8.70 and $8.80.",1
"The complementary capabilities of our two great companies will create an ideal mix of talent and expertise and builds on our common cultures and shared values, coupled with Jacobs global platform and long-term client relationships, we will enhance our ability to deliver differentiated services and solutions across key growth industries resulting in business opportunities neither companies could create on their own.",1
"I think it's important to note that IS and T backlog was $851 million in the quarter and the book-to-bill was $1.3 for the quarter, following the strong book-to-bill of one-to-one on average for the last three years.",1
"Operating earnings, on the other hand, are up $131 million or 3.1% on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margins.",1
"We continue to benefit from strong end-market demand across both our Aerospace and Technology and Buildings and Infrastructure lines of business, and we experienced modestly improved fundamentals in our Petroleum, Chemicals and Mining sectors.",1
It's also important to note that our quarter-end backlog continue to exclude the impact of close to $850 million of previous awards that remained under protest at the end of the first quarter.,-1
"We do expect that our effective tax rate will approach 25% now for the year given the new law and the result ‚Äì and as a result, we expect that our EPS for the year will benefit by approximately $0.30 due to the change.",1
"From an end market standpoint, we continue to benefit from key national government spending priorities such as the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and NASA that are seeing funding plus-ups.",1
"Looking forward, we expect mid-single sequential growth off of our Q2 numbers, resulting in double-digit year-over-year pro forma growth as we continue to ramp newly awarded contracts.",1
"So for 2018 companywide, all of this rolls up to $32.35 billion to $32.45 billion of revenue, up 4.4% to 4.8% over 2017.",1
"If you assume ‚Ç¨1.15 to the pound for the rest of the year, that would have a full-year positive impact on profit of ¬£21 million, and that leaves the underlying performance in the period down by ¬£15 million.",-1
"From a Jacobs Connected Enterprise standpoint, we continue to make progress leveraging our operational domain expertise to capture adjacent digital opportunities within our core ECR customer base.",1
"And moving to slide 11, you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the third quarter of our fiscal 2018 year.",0
We now expect revenue to be slightly over $8.5 billion with margins slightly better than the previous forecast resulting in operating earnings of $745 million to $755 million.,1

"Before I get started, I want to try to preempt a few questions, and just give you as much of an update as I can on the whole pension and pay negotiations, and the industrial relations climate.",0
"When you exclude the impact of the Best Buy Mobile profit share payment, international SG&A expenses were flat compared to the prior period.",0
We‚Äôve had a strong year-to-date cash -- we had strong year-to-date cash from operations of $2.7 billion and free cash flow of over $2.4 billion.,1
All of these priorities are currently underway and we expect each of them to deliver gradual and incremental operating improvements throughout the year.,1
"In the Domestic segment, total revenue declined 0.3% to $12.6 billion, but this decline was driven by the loss of revenue from 49 big-box stores that were closed earlier in the year, but was substantially offset by the positive 0.9% comparable store sales increase previously discussed, and incremental revenue from 126 additional Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores.",-1
And we're going to see GLS take that very careful approach to deep partnerships and careful geographic expansion in new ways.,0

The strong performance in the second quarter led to an increase in our outlook for the year as we'll discuss on the next chart.,1
"And again, these results were dampened by the impacts of the HATFA legislation in the quarter, which amounted to $0.11 of earnings per share.",-1
"Across the company, we must have a passionate commitment to serving our customers in such an extraordinary manner that they become promoters of Best Buy.",0
"And this leads me to expect an overall level of net investments, i.e., including the proceeds from property disposals of at least ¬£620 million this fiscal year.",0
"In the mobile category in the second quarter, we began offering customers the option to purchase installment bidding plans with the top three U. S.",0
"In total, while our year-over-year retail labor costs are now lower, our overall investment in customer-facing labor including vendor-funded labor has increased.",1
"And we expect to see stronger results as the program matures, and we improve their online searchability in overall multi-channel customer experience over the next several quarters.",1
"When we take that out, we see that the Express EBIT has actually grown by 19% year-over-year, and on the margin side, we have seen an expansion by 1.3 percentage points.",0
"And cash flow is a bit down year-over-year, but that is also primarily due to unfavorable working capital movement which, of course, we hope to catch up with again in the fourth quarter.",-1
These projected share repurchases coupled with dividend payments are expected to resolve in our returning the vast majority of annual free cash to stockholders through 2017 and continuing our longstanding strategies of disciplined cash deployment and value creation.,1
"The absolute negative free cash flow reflects, as usual, a once-a-year payment of around ‚Ç¨540 million that we make every year in January for the Civil Servant Pension arrangement with the German government.",-1
"Finally in Q2, we've seen a slight reversal of that trend, but it had a huge impact on the pension liabilities of ‚Ç¨2.7 billion.",0
"The current or previous 38.5 hour work week will remain unchanged, and the current working regulations, including the employee redundancy protection, are extended to 2019.",0
"Adjusted for currency, it was only 0.7%, but here we also had a fuel surcharge impact on the transportation segment within Supply Chain.",0

"And because of our better than expected performance, we are increasing our outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations.",1
"For NPD, the tablet category declined nearly 30% similar to last quarter and computing declined high single digits versus low single digits last quarter.",-1
"In fact, in the first quarter we saw early progress in improving our net promoter score in appliance delivery and installation.",1
"Over on to page six, we look at cash flow performance by quarter because I think it's a useful reminder about the seasonal pattern of our cash flow generation and certainly we generate most of our operating cash flow in the second half.",0
"As an example, we have a project focused on reducing the amount of open box appliances we take into our stores by addressing root cause issues.",0

"As I've said repeatedly, we continue to run our business on the assumption that higher fuel prices will someday come back.",0
"First of all, we do expect that we can offset that volume decline partly by price increases, and our pricing policy remains the pricing policy for bulk as well as for single mail items, which is well above inflation.",-1
"And we do expect that our focus will remain on, of course, volume growth and cost leadership with the expectation that it will improve our cash profitability.",1
"We'll elaborate later on the call on the significant progress we're achieving through our various value enhancing initiatives, including fleet modernization, international expansion, the roll-out of rouge and our network diversification.",1
"The yield declined to 5.5% reflected an increase in average stage length of 2.6%, which had the effect of reducing system yield by 1.5 percentage points.",-1
"International growth is being pursued on a lower-cost basis, primarily through the introduction of new Boeing 787 aircraft, increased seating on our Boeing 777 aircraft, and by a increase in flights operated by Air Canada rouge.",1
"Our commitment to innovation will continue to bear fruit as the DoD adapts to operating under constrained budgets and relies more on industry to invest in new technologies that create affordable solutions that can be delivered quickly, and with that I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions.",1

"So these, in short, are our comments for the nine months results and the outlook for the rest of the year.",0
Book-to-bill for Tactical was 1.04 and sequentially funded backlog was up modestly from 4Q's $564 million to $575 million this quarter.,1

Air Canada also assumes that Canadian dollar will trade on average at Canadian $1.03 per U. S. dollar for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2013.,0
We do not anticipate significant rate increases during the second half of the year as the structural oversupply remains on the main trade lanes.,-1
We affirmed our confidence in the future by setting for ourselves more ambitious financial targets for the next three years.,0
Our traffic increase reflected growth on our services to South America and to traditional leisure destinations and included growth in all our cabins.,1

"First-half free cash flow was supporting our deleveraging priority, reducing term loan debt $200 million in the quarter and $383 million since closing the transaction in late May.",-1
"Altogether, these actions are expected to generate modest savings in fiscal 2016 and about $20 million to $25 million in fiscal 2017.",0
"Under this structure approximately 80% of the financing is funded with the U. S. dollar debt, while the remaining 20% is yen equity.",0

"In the interim, customers will have the opportunity to preview the new aircraft on select flights between Toronto and Vancouver during August and between Toronto and the cities of Munich and Milan during September and October.",1
"Moving on to slide number four, and before we dive into the details by product, allow us to give you a little bit of the big picture again, as we outlined at our Capital Market Day in November of last year.",0
So we decided that we would try to keep our presentation ‚Äì the formal presentation short so that we have enough time to engage with your and answer your questions.,0
"We had a solid cost performance in the quarter, even with the unfavorable currency impact, which underscores the progress made thus far in executing on our initiatives, all of which are meeting or exceeding our expectations.",1
"Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was a company record high of $371 million, compared to $355 million last year, which included the divested truckload business.",1
Interest expense for the quarter decreased more than 20% to $74 million from $95 million a year ago as a result of the debt paydown associated with the North American truckload sale and the two repricings of our term loan we completed in August of 2016 and March of this year.,1
"We continue to include historical information for Tactical orders, revenue and backlog as supplemental information at the end of this presentation.",0

"Revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, increased 4.5% year over year, and daily LTL tonnage declines moderated to 5.3% in the quarter.",1
"These strong results reflect a strong execution of our strategic plan and tremendous efforts by the entire Air Canada workforce, I personally want to acknowledge.",1
"As we mentioned, we're reporting a 16% higher EBITDAR level this quarter despite what is commonly viewed as a low-growth global economic environment, not unlike the previous quarter.",1
"In the first quarter of this year, the strong sales growth trend continued with a new revenue record level of ‚Ç¨429 million.",1
"One, a 13.8% return on investments in 2013; two, the implementation of the pension benefit amendments, which are estimated to have decreased our solvency deficit by about $970 million; three, company contributions of $225 million in 2013; and last but not least, the application of a prescribed discount rate of 3.9% to calculate future pension obligations.",-1
"At the end of 2013, we had $105 million of federal tax NOLs and will be acquiring over $20 million of federal tax NOLs with Pacer, which means we won't be a cash tax payer for several years.",0
"In July, MTU received the first ‚Äì as a first partner of the TP400 consortium, the EASA145 certification for maintaining the TP400 engines in our shop.",1
Next year we're targeting full year adjusted EBITDA of at least $1.25 billion and our target for 2018 is $1.7 billion of EBITDA.,0
These metrics are the main financial indicators we use to measure the continuing success of our long range plan which is focused on sustained profitable growth.,1
"Also as you may recall, we recorded favorable tax-related provision adjustments of $23 million in the second quarter of last year 2015, which we do not expect to record in the second quarter of 2016.",1
"And as you can see in the appendix of the presentation, the total group order book increased by 3% to more than ‚Ç¨15 billion.",1
We've amped-up our sales efforts to get in front of high potential customers that can increasingly benefit from our capabilities.,1
"Page 10, the  (00:13:32) of the EBIT from Q2 2017 to Q2 2018, of course, I will say is a bit mixed up with the strike effect.",1
"And the liquidity situation is extremely comfortable, standing at ‚Ç¨5.9 billion, with ‚Ç¨4.1 billion of cash  (00:17:58) and ‚Ç¨1.8 billion undrawn credit lines facility.",1
"I'm pleased to report that we delivered revenue, earnings and cash flow at/or above the high end of our guided ranges for the fiscal year.",1
"But then the division has grown from DKK 47 million to DKK 66 million in EBIT in the quarter and also we have good developments, and we have a big potential also for future improvements if we manage to improve the situations in some of the new areas that we are in.",1
"While we won't share with you specific dollar targets for this additional scope, we are confident these actions will help us win more business more profitably over time.",1
"I know capital deployment continues to be a topic of interest for the investor community, and therefore, I want to remind you that our capital deployment priorities remain as they always have, with paying our dividend at the top of the list.",0
"And hence we have ‚Äì once again, we have gained market share, which is a fundamental strategy of DSV, and we are very happy that it has been possible for us to do that then.",1
"So Road disappointed themselves, just slightly on the EBIT line, but I would say growth-wise they have done very, very well.",-1
The same can be said a little bit for the Solutions division; more or less same things happening as we saw in Road.,0
And it is in this framework that we have decided to take a major step by acquiring a stake in Virgin Atlantic and by signing strategic commercial and capitalistic alliances with Delta Airlines and China Eastern.,1
"During the call, we will make forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding the company and our expectations about its future financial and operating performance.",0
"We develop our guidance through a diligent and rigorous process based on the best information available to us at the time, recognizing that our business and the markets in which we operate are fluid and often difficult to predict.",0
"So, it explains part of the reduction also the fuel bill, which is extremely consistent, of course, ‚Ç¨1.5 billion over the year.",0
"In Q2, as you might remember, we saw a volume development, a negative volume development of minus 3%, so minus 1% is not where we should be, but at least we are catching up.",-1
"With these new levers, we are targeting profitable growth for the long-haul operation of between 2% and 3% per year through to 2020.",1
"And of course, if we look at the share buybacks on slide number 11, you can see how much money we have allocated to the shareholders and expect to allocate during the next quarter as well.",0
"In terms of unit cost, as you see, we are perfectly on track and compliant with what we were targeting, it's minus 2% in 2013, minus 2% in 2014.",1
"So if the GP and especially the EBIT develops in the right direction, we can live with also a lower net revenue.",0
"We expect interest expense of approximately $145 million for the year, reflecting today's LIBOR rates and the improved spreads that we secured in our recent debt restructuring.",1
"Cash flow from operations in the quarter of $164 million was better than expected, as a higher level of advance payments more than offset a higher level of DSO than anticipated ending the year at 66 days.",1
"In our Defense Solutions segment, revenue was down 9% in the quarter, a disappointing number that reflects two key items.",-1
"And we actually do see quite good results elsewhere, both in Eastern Europe and in Central and Southern Europe, where we do see good results.",1
"As you can see from John's introduction, we have a number of important topics to cover today, not the least of which is our strong performance in the face of difficult market conditions.",-1
This reflects our added emphasis on bidding on more opportunities in areas where we can offer best value solutions to our customers.,1
"But in total, a fuel bill of almost stable, let us say, during the year 2017 compared to 2016 which means that if you take all these element together, clearly, the last part of the improvement of the operating income between the two years is explained by the commercial performance.",1
First result we expect that the new debt according to IFRS 16 will be lower than the adjusted net debt.,1
It tells me also that the former UTi people have embraced our culture and we are extremely happy about that.,1
And what we can say that we increased the revenues by ‚Ç¨20 million in the year which is something compared with the past performance.,1
"And third, lower security product revenues mainly due to timing of shipments and the completion of large systems maintenance contracts.",0
"Organizationally, during the quarter, we continued to strengthen our company leadership through the addition of Frank Kendall, Former Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics to our board of directors.",1
"This reflects an 8.8% margin for the quarter, a sequential improvement of over 150 basis points, representing a return to more normalized program performance in this segment.",1
"Basically, if you look at it, all the areas apart from the bank contributed positively and Express & Parcels in Portugal, it contributed positively.",1
"So, more and more, the fees that we receive from the stock that is  placed analyzed (29:29) will become more and more important in the sustainability of the profitability of this segment inside of Financial Service.",1
"Perhaps you are aware of HOP!, the new company, the regional company that has been launched in April with a good level of bookings, plus 10% compared to the comparable period of last year, and we have also reduced capacity by 15 aircraft at summer 2014 (sic) [2013] (40:41) compared to 2011.",1
"It doesn't prevent us for going further, but it's a part of our short and mid-haul restructuring plan that I will comment lightly because it will be commented further and firstly in front of the war council, but I will comment in a few minutes.",-1
"Also notable in the business is that after a long period of revenue declines within IS&GS, we were able to inflect to growth in the quarter, with revenues from legacy IS&GS up 1% on a year-over-year basis.",1
"No surprise therefore that tax revenues are down compared to the trend that we have during the first quarter, and it has actually deteriorated throughout the quarter because April was much more in line with the first quarter, where June was definitely down year-on-year quite significantly.",-1
"For the rest, we'll stick ‚Äì we haven't changed our hedging policy with the exception of this production that we have discussed already.",0
"As I've said before, we went into the year with a plan that would deliver more than 70 basis points of margin expansion.",1
"Why, it's a bit more than 40% of our cost, that was the case for 2014, given the lower price of the fuel, you would expect that this 40% would come down slightly, probably closer to 35%, 37%, 38%, something like that.",-1
"On the long-haul side, we have achieved a 1.6% growth in capacity for a unit revenue which is minus 0.3%.",-1
"We have a good contribution of the working cap, plus ‚Ç¨113 million, and this is coming after a very strong contribution last year.",1
"But also, we have some ‚Äì a part of this difference comes from non-normal impacts that we have in 2016 we did not have yet in 2017 at the same level.",0
"That's up 7% x-acquisitions primarily driven by higher volume and a strong value gap. Margins were down 90 basis points on a reported basis, down 30 basis points excluding the impact of Lufkin in the quarter.",1
"In November, Keith and Jeff will update our portfolio and business strategy at GE Capital and give you a sense for our long-term goals and simplification across the company.",0
"In many of the 22 years that I'd been here, we've posted sizable losses in the first quarter that have required us to dig out of the hole in the second and third quarters.",-1
We expect our R&D to be better and mix will be negative is our product sales are growing faster than service.,0
"We make value creating investments in our business and building on the practice we started in 2007, we return capital to our owners in a thoughtful and disciplined way, all while marinating a strong balance sheet.",1
"So with that, we're announcing today that we're targeting the IPO of our North American retail finance business for the end of July.",1
"The airlines as a group are performing much better on many, many fronts than we were just a few years ago.",1
We continue to plan against the global macro backdrop that is volatile and one where some economic projections have recently been revised downward.,-1
"With novel in vitro technologies developed at the GRC, we have expanded our service offering to allow researchers to better understand the underlying biology of disease, which of course in turn leads to the development of these new precision medicines which we then help to manufacture, and that brings me on to how critical we are for the biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry.",1
Our commercial paper program remains stable at $25 billion and we had $10 billion of long-term debt issuance for the year excluding the activity related to Synchrony.,1
"Headline growth in revenue at 7.7% and 6.5% in operating profit, with organic growth at nearly 5% in revenue and 5.3% in operating profit, a little bit better than we were originally forecasting at the half year.",1
We continue to grow our position in supporting blue-light emergency services and we're pursuing further opportunities both in the UK and internationally.,1
"And to give you a sense for how things are moving, our pre-tax income for the first six months of 2015 was $610 million which is about equal to what we earned for all of 2013.",0
"We also had number of positive development in the Asia Pacific region, established new sales office in Japan, announced the sale of eight 412 for national defense and booked eight helicopter order in China with option for seven more.",1
"Additional information about the cost expectations, capacity plans, fuel hedging, capital expenditures and other items can be found in our investor update, included in our form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com.",0

"Overall, GE Capital reported $387 million of earnings and we ended the quarter with $176 billion of continuing ENI including liquidity.",0
Another example of integration benefit is the rollout of the new products for program for our turboprop customers based on assessments ProAdvantage life-cycle service program.,1
"While we've seen a slowdown in the commercial helicopter market, our commercial win rate continues to move around the world.",-1
So those are core competencies of how we compete and things that we will continue to invest in 2015 and beyond.,0
"In total, we expect to ship 110 gas turbines and 125 AGPs with 60% to 65% of these units shipping in the second half of the year in 2016.",0

"We continue to see a dragon Oil & Gas with revenue down 15% to 20% for the year, and rest of GE will grow at a healthy pace.",-1
"From an earnings per share standpoint, $0.83 for the quarter compared to $0.73 last year or a 13.7% increase, and that also goes with the weighted average shares below that to a decrease of 2% or 143 million shares outstanding.",1
"With three quarters of 2017 now behind us, we continue to be very enthusiastic about our results and our future, and about fulfilling our purpose of creating an airline that people love.",1

"Again, thank you very much to everyone at Robinson for a solid second quarter and thank you all, as well, for listening in.",0

"In half of the quarter, we achieved top line growth and continued our strong cash performance while furthering our business development efforts on new products across the businesses.",1

"Between 30% to 50% of our passengers in the different domestic markets are business passengers, the rest are leisure passengers which grow in many cases up to three times thus far, that are price sensitive and require lower fares.",1
We think we'll have sort of high-single-digit organic decline for the rest of the year but then gives us really easy comps for 2016.,-1
"Additionally, our focus on operational performance, even where sales growth has been slow, enhances our competitive position and shareholder value.",1
"We wanted to mention briefly an update in terms of our strategic initiatives that we have already mentioned, part of it has to do with the cost reduction, which I think we've already discussed.",0
"On the cargo side as we've discussed, we have seen generally a global cargo market that has been relatively flat over the past 2 years.",0
Another piece of good news when we look at FY ‚Äì we're really comfortable with the second half of the year is that we're not really seeing any industrial contagion at all.,1
The non-operating result amounted to $126 million loss in the second quarter compared to $144 million loss in the second quarter 2017.,-1
"So, we literally cut our working capital as a function of annualized sales in half in the last two years from 6.2% to 3.1% and that really speaks to the quality of that work that all of our independent operating people do executing our strategy.",-1
"Sales related to Aerospace, industrial gas turbine systems and natural gas systems for buses and trucks in China were particularly strong.",1
"We are maintaining our full-year outlook for fiscal 2015 with sales anticipated to be between $2.05 billion and $2.15 billion, and earnings per share expected to be between $2.65 and $2.90 per share.",0
"Now on the not-so-positive side, what we've had and that you saw the guidance that we released a few weeks ago, we estimate that there was a negative impact in our results during this quarter that amounts to approximately $150 million mostly as a result of decreased revenue.",-1
It's probably one of the most important steps in the consolidation process of LAN and TAM and this will be a gradual change to the LATAM brand.,0
"So for the year, we should have a nice growth out of completing the New York City project and the continuation of our Saudi project, but we're going to have fewer tag shipments and we've seen a fall-off in tag in 2016 related to railcars which wouldn't surprise anybody and people tend to forget about but we have a tag on every railcar that gets produced.",1
"Next off, when we get into the segment detail, and I should have included this that the medical segments of 72% gross margin, there are segments at 61% gross margin.",0
"We have, during the first quarter, launched the new VIP Lounge in Santiago, so certain initiatives to improve the passengers' experience before the flight.",1
"During the course of today's call, we'll make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and also further detailed in our SEC filings.",0
"On a year-over-year basis, we delivered net cost savings, along with volume growth, but this was more than offset by headwinds from higher aluminum prices and performance shortfalls in our Rings, Discs and Global Rolled Products operations.",-1
"Revenue for the first quarter came in at $3.4 billion, up $253 million or 8% year-over-year as aluminum prices accounted for $109 million or approximately 40% of the increase.",1
"Therefore, the increase in volatility and aluminum prices will impact results to a greater degree, both on the upside when aluminum prices go down, and on the downside when aluminum prices increase.",-1
"Just recently, the government of New York was talking about the incredible success of the cashless tolling projects that we managed last year and into this year which came in both below budget and on time.",1
"This is driven by a reduction of $450 million in our total gross debt as well as by an increase of 6.3% in our EBITDAR, which reached $2.1 billion for 2016.",1
"With the sequestration, a more I would say decent level but high level in United States and due to budget pressure in Europe we will see further squeeze of defense budget.",0
"As I also have stated many times here, I will not go into which countries that have an interest for the Gripen, because that will just create a lot of turbulence towards us.",-1
"And as we have said, now we see a good positive execution during Q3 and good payment both in the Gripen program and in the Kockums business, how we started up that one.",1
"Qantas Assure, our health insurance joint venture with nib is meeting all milestones and is on track to achieve its business case of a 2% to 3% share of the Australian health insurance market within five years.",1

"This is my fifth year-end report, and I can just notice that the interest for our questions and the company have rised since the last five years.",1
"So, still, tough market conditions, but we have never ever had offered volumes that are so big and the potential is that have that volume as we have today.",0
"And the fit, I think, is extremely good, especially due to that we have a very strong naval capability already before we purchased Kockums.",1
"And that means also a signal to the market, of course, that the Rafale and the Eurofighter are in the end of their development programs as well.",0
"And that also goes without saying, especially now when we have an upcoming election in Sweden but also in other places around the world, how do you protect a society for this type of attack on our digital platforms.",0
A key pillar of our strategy has been to maximize the group's leading domestic position through a domestic dual brand strategy.,1
"Qantas Cash now has a massive AUD 1.1 billion of currency loaded; Red Planet, our newly launched digital marketing business, was profitable within its first year of operation, a fantastic result.",1
And this is mainly due to a shift that we now are in between development and production within the Gripen E order.,0
"The Qantas Group today announced an underlying profit before tax of $223 million, and a statutory profit after tax of $111 million.",0
"So, that's a good development right now, and of course the backlog supports this but also new orders coming in.",1
"Dynamics, as we've talked about, has less sales this first half compared to last year, and it's mainly due to timing of the deliveries.",0
"Qantas International underlying EBIT was up 6.7% to AUD 399 million, with the operating margin maintained at 5.8% even as fuel cost rose.",1
This was driven by the phasing of capital expenditure with over AUD 1 billion of our AUD 1.5 billion full year capital expenditure program spent in the first half.,0
"Against the backdrop of significant overcapacity in the global market, unit revenue declined 7% in the first half, with this trend expected to moderate in the second half of 2017 on 6% market growth capacity.",-1
"Regarding Executive Jets, we delivered a total of 15 aircraft in the first quarter, broken by 11 light aircraft and 4 large aircraft.",0
"In terms of outlook, again, I know it's difficult for the market and for ourselves at this time of year because we have such little visibility over H2.",-1
"Going forward, next page, by business unit, in terms of Commercial Aviation, we forecast deliveries of between 95 to 100 E-Jets and net revenues from $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion.",0
"And here we see the breakdown of this backlog ‚Äì 67% for Commercial Aviation, 20% Defense & Security and also 13% for Executive business.",-1
"We've got volume discount deals in place for a number of our airports, and we plan to grow approximately 50% into primary and secondary airports over the next number of years, which will keep the focus on costs and keep the costs down.",1
"So moving to next page, the highlights for Executive Jets, we delivered 109 Executive Jets in 2017, broken by 72 light jets and 32 large jets; including the delivery of the 1,100th Executive Jet in 2017.",0
"That would represent 9% traffic growth over last year, where based on what visibility we have on Q3 yields at the moment, which is pretty good, we still have very limited yield visibility on Q4.",1
"So that means that we had in terms of average terms of debt, an extension that we'll show you more detail later in this presentation, but it is important for the management of the profile of the debt of the company.",0
This year we intend to pay out a dividend in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or the first quarter of 2015.,0
"In relation to our debt, it's still very comfortable and adapted to our profile, which has a maturity average of 6.2 years.",0
We've been careful to ensure that those aircraft deliveries are controlled over an eight-year period with the results that means we won't have any capacity increase greater than 6% annually as a result of aircraft redeliveries.,0
"The new guidance or the revision of the guidance that we are making today is in line with what the market is doing, right?",0
"When compared to the same quarter of last year, we see a higher selling expenses due to the number of deliveries compensated by a lower G&A which reflects the company focus on cost reduction.",0

"All this give us a lot of confidence and given the latest contracts that we secured, our order book actually is at historical high, right.",0
"So, all-in-all, we are delivering in line with what we said that we're going to deliver when we did enter into our restructuring program back in November 2012.",-1
"We see further opportunities to enhance our value proposition on ground, while also driving productivity by adding more self-service capabilities and automation into the system.",1
"On top of this, we will then ‚Äì as Rickard already mentioned, we will be able to already of next year take out another SEK 1 billion of cost and have initiated activities to see further cost improvements in the range of billions going forward, which will be more specified during a late presentation in the autumn.",1

"Journeys is the leading omnichannel retailer of branded fashion footwear for teens in North America, a position that is held for two-plus decades, as its strong sales in the fourth quarter once again demonstrate Journeys' understanding of teens and unrivaled access to merchandise this customer wants, equip it uniquely well to serve this fickle customer and navigate the fashion steps that are inherently part of life in this segment of the market.",1
"February comps were down 8% but for March and April, which we look at on a combined basis to eliminate the Easter shift, comps improved to negative 1% and May comps through last Saturday were up 1%.",-1
"However, this was more than eclipsed by the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers repeat in the NBA Finals for the fourth consecutive year in a short series, which didn't generate sales equal to last year's levels.",0
"However, with the negative comp, remaining operations particularly Journeys deleveraged, due mostly to rent expense from new stores and renewals, higher depreciation, higher credit card charges, and higher advertising expense to stimulate sale.",-1
"Journeys managed selling salaries very aggressively in the quarter and expenses came in better than last year, even with the negative comp.",-1

The increase in chargeback expense we experienced was much greater than we had anticipated when we scheduled later implementation of the technology.,-1
As expected gross margins in all the Lids' retail businesses were down as we executed our plan to freshen inventory.,-1
"For example, we know direct customers receiving a Journeys catalog in a recent drop subsequently made purchases, 60% of the time in stores and 40% online, capturing activity across channel.",0
They come to shop because they know Journeys is the house of brands and they will find the brands they like and want.,0
We continue our focus on enhancing the position of each of our businesses as a leader in its niche by pursuing initiatives to make them even more difficult for others to replicate.,-1
"Despite higher sales, adjusted operating income decreased to $74.4 million from $88.8 million, largely as a result of the gross margin decrease.",-1
"With Lids' comp at close to zero or negative level, Q1 and Q2, the smaller earnings quarters, are hurt the most given higher fixed expenses.",-1

"Another one is the partnership with key accounts, which is also a key way to develop the categories to leverage our innovation.",1
"Couple of readings on this performance: One, the efficiency of our manufacturing and distribution network that was able to offset a large part of the headwinds deriving from the strengthening of the Chinese renminbi; secondly, about a third of the Wholesale growth came from an improvement of price mix we generated significant benefits to the margin; lastly, talking about Retail.",1
Both Wholesale and Retail did have an acceleration in their performance during the second quarter versus the first quarter trend.,0
"Overall, we are seeing sound growth in all channel with Platinum department store and outlet driving the growth; growth which is quite balanced between units and unit revenue growth, which we believe is sound.",1

"On an after tax basis, you're looking at approximately ‚Ç¨68 million of profit and really the reason why you see a net cost charge at operating income level and a net profit charged at net income level is mainly due to the tax benefit derived from the Patent Box for the year 2015 and 2016.",1
"So, I would expect a second quarter broadly in line with the first, while the headwind should diminish quite substantially in the second half of 2015, so I hope that by June, this strong headwind will diminish.",-1

"Actually, half of this campaign had more than 3 million page views and a lot of pictures the customers uploaded.",0

"So what would happen if we decided that we do not want to grow actually capital market share that we do not want to grow 20% to 25% in the long-term, but that we're fine to grow with the market at 10% or maybe 15%.",-1
"The increase in core fee income primarily reflects a $1.7 million increase in letter of credit revenue in the third quarter primarily due to nonrecurring item in Q2 and a $660,000 or 6.4% increase in credit card revenue to $10.9 million driven by higher interchange fee income due to increased volume, partially offset by higher reward expense.",1
"The key in our view lies in delivering the right kind of growth, through focus and discipline and the efforts of our talented and dedicated employees, we believe we can make the most of our near term opportunities while positioning ourselves to take advantage of the significant long-term opportunities that lie ahead.",1

"Despite persistent competition and continued M&A activity among our clients, we see a healthy stream of new clients and continued momentum in our pipeline.",1
"In the meantime, we remain focused on delivering high quality growth, driving fee income, maintaining stable credit quality, and continuing to position ourselves for long-term growth.",1
In the fourth quarter that translated into more early stage clients proactively moving excess funds into higher yielding off-balance sheet options than what we experience in a no rate increase environment.,1
"So, you can see, how capturing companies at their early stages creates a built-in pipeline for growth and capturing the best companies can accelerate that growth.",1

"Following are some of the steps we have taken to recover our containers: assigned one of our most senior executives to work full-time as that of an internal team focused on locating and recovering Hanjin containers; created an IT recovery tool, which staff in the field used to determine acceptable cost parameters for recovering containers; arrested several vessels in order to pressure Hanjin to provide us with more assistance in recovering containers; and informed our insurers regarding Hanjin.",0
"We maintain $80 million of insurance after a $5 million deductible covering lost containers, recovery and repair costs and lost revenue.",-1
"As communicated this morning, we are able in light of good organic growth momentum and good execution on our transformation program, which is implemented faster than we originally expected.",1
"Number two, the older in-fleet units we sell are often fully depreciated while they are replaced by higher-cost new units with higher depreciation.",0
"Due to the need to recover Hanjin containers and restrictions under our bank facilities, our investment in new containers was extremely limited during the first quarter.",-1
"Before we dig into the details of the quarter, let me briefly give you a couple of highlights from the third quarter.",0
"The bookings made in April should increase utilization by approximately 1% once the containers are leased out, which we expect to happen largely within the next two months.",1

As we continue to incur higher levels of professional fees driven by the ongoing integration of our back office operation and legal entity restructuring.,0

"The CHMP also notes that treatment with Strensiq improves skeletal structure as demonstrated by x-ray appearance of joints, and histological appearance of bone biopsy material, and by apparent catch-up height-gain.",1
Soliris revenue growth was impacted mainly by three factors: increasing macroeconomic weakness in Latin America resulting in an impact to new patient starts and treatment interruptions primarily in Brazil and Argentina; currency headwinds; and our usual seasonality that we see every year as we move from Q4 to Q1.,-1
"We have established our leadership in complement biology over the past 20 years, which gives us great conviction that our complement portfolio will enable us to serve an increasing number of patients.",1

"So while the capital raising market continued to be quite strong ‚Äì and you can see that in the numbers, healthy level of IPOs, healthy level of capital raisings ‚Äì the previous half, as you can see on the chart at the bottom, last year was also quite strong.",1
"So as you go through the waves of this chart, the first wave was the investment in our data center.",0
"And there you can see, if you look at the bottom line, growth year-on-year first half to first half of 8% and growth half on half, first half to the previous second half, of 5.4%.",1
"Nevertheless, when we look at the environment, we are seeing stabilization and modest improvements in global economic conditions, particularly in the West.",1
"And capital raised, a little bit below AUD 1 billion, down 51% always a weak period, but of course, people are taking a bit of a breather, perhaps after the rush we saw in the most recent quarter in the IPO market.",-1
This is a unit that we feel we have to continue to reinforce with a great commitment to improving it in the future.,1
"Basically in costs, again as I said, for Settlement & Registration, the reform in settlement and clearing regulation is the reason why costs are rising significantly in the quarter and the year-to-date, but as soon as the reforms are concluded and it all goes online starting in February, these costs will no longer continue.",0
"It's strategic, it means more companies being listed, larger companies trading, and it is of course part of our core business, and we're very pleased to see these developments.",1
"And that drop I think means that the markets right now are going through a new cycle of lower volumes where we think that the uncertainties that are hovering over the markets all over the world having an impact with the American elections, maybe the lack of direction in the markets in general and that's all the markets, we are no exception of course to this.",-1
"And, in any case, 17 points higher than our peer group average and 11% in the cost to income ratio.",0
"As to spreads, we're still very happy with the performance of spreads and the evolution of the different market segments.",1
"And with the reform, we've had a relatively significant increase of the variable items as regards to the situation of BME within the ‚Äì or in the midst of the flow of cost that will have to do with  swift (27:37) and other things which we have to carry, and we thought that this was a good time to get hold ‚Äì to get a group of this and do it and we've done it.",0
"And if they weren't on a market like the MARF market, they wouldn't have that possibility, so we're trying to help to rebalance the financing possibilities for small companies here in Spain.",0
"And I want to remind you here, although I'll talk about this later on when we talk about clearing, that last year we took the decision to separate out the clearing business, which was obviously based on BME clearing so that we could track what was happening in clearing revenues before the structural change of October this year, with the reform of the securities markets with respect to after trade business.",0
We always explain on this point that this is a key focus of our attention in the company because we believe that the final dividend paid out is really built on this attempt that the company has made to diversify revenues and to contribute into the company revenues that are not only linked to volumes.,0
"And the impact is quite important for this unit, that's revenues then where we see a slight positive tendency in registration compared to third quarter  (27:12) in the fourth quarter.",1
"Scope-on-scope, so excluding last year's ‚Ç¨7 million contribution from our Italian activities, our net insurance result increased by ‚Ç¨38 million to reach ‚Ç¨475 million, up 9%, and this despite adverse weather events in Belgium and UK, which has an impact of ‚Ç¨62 million and also ‚Ç¨55 million lower support of net capital gains in the course of the first half of the year.",1
"Dollar margins have been squeezed due to lower realized selling prices and aggressive competition in exports-led markets, but this has to an extent been offset by higher shipments.",0
"One, operating leverage through higher shipments; second, cost optimization, our footprint adjustment in Europe and our ongoing management gains impact on variable costs; and third, operational improvement, this is largely in our ACIS business, which has not been achieving its potential in recent years.",1
"In our Mining business, the impact of the declining iron ore price is clear, although this was partially offset by improved cost performance, so the net impact was negative $108 million.",-1
"Ultimately, this will be achieved through free cash flow so I do not want to put a specific timeline on this target.",1
We are making progress on our plan to take iron ore production capacity from our own mines from 56 million tonnes in 2012 up to 84 million tonnes in 2015.,1
The bridge also shows that our steel business was positively impacted by both volumes and the price-cost effect during Q2.,-1
"And despite the market impact of the political instability in Ukraine, EBITDA per tonne was clearly higher than year-ago levels.",-1
"Although we have trimmed our demand forecast slightly, we still expect underlying steel demand to grow by over 3% in 2014.",1

"Then data and analytics in order to be really digital compliant and the frontier of the digitalization in the banking sector, and then other reinforcement in governance, controlling function in all the other area of the bank.",0
"I'm proud of our contribution to Italy in terms of support to the real economy, with around 8,000 companies back on track, over 40,000 jobs preserved and over ‚Ç¨25 billion medium/long-term loans to Italian families and corporates in the first semester.",0
"Noninterest expenses were up CAD 44 million or 13% from a year ago, primarily driven by increased business volumes and employee-related compensation.",-1
"Provisions for non-impaired loans saw a release of CAD 33 million, and you'll see that we provided details on the lower right chart and highlight a CAD 27-million release relating to loans that are being transferred from non-impaired to impaired, an CAD 11-million release attributed to stage migration portfolio movement and prepayment, all of which was partially offset by a CAD 5 million increase relating to our quarterly forward-looking information update.",0
"As this has been more than offset by the decline of the relative equity indices, assets under control have grown by ‚Ç¨10 billion to a total of ‚Ç¨386 billion.",1
"If they're able to deliver that and importantly, as leaders, if we're able to elicit those characteristics from them, they're going to be engaged in both their local communities make sure that we're delivering great experience for our customers, and, of course, we're holding ourselves to make sure we're delivering better outcomes overall for them.",1
"But, of course, that scale also confers a number of advantages, including the ability to be able to invest in the best digital assets, which are increasingly a big part of both the way we serve our customers, and I think will underpin our competitive and strategic advantages.",1

We're very pleased to report that the strong start in the first quarter of 2015 has now led into a really impressive first half of the year.,1
"Given the significant 2015 overachievement, we will still outperform our original assumptions for the two years combined, but it is important not to go overboard in projections for 2016.",1
We did not rely on the bridge financing via commercial paper that we now put in place at extremely attractive rates.,1
"I expect a bit of an increase in the coming quarters, and so for the full year, I've modeled 30%, or just below, in line with our earlier guidance.",1
"Currency tailwind at the bottom line was just as high as for sales, also around 13 percentage points in the second quarter.",0
We are expecting improvements in the post-acute care area through a combination of operating upgrades and some portfolio divestitures over time.,1
"But as I just said, this is a highly volatile business with limited visibility, notoriously hard to predict, and where you just cannot extrapolate from a quarterly run rate, where individual drugs and launches can make and have made a major difference.",-1

"One, Kabi is strengthening its Medical Devices business with a slight dilution of the blended growth rate in line with our announcement at the time of the Fenwal acquisition.",1
Strength of the U. S. dollar and the Chinese yuan in particular will likely give a translation boost to our projected constant currency reported numbers.,1
"On to net interest, which was ‚Ç¨135 million in Q4 very much in line with the prior quarter and that took the full year to ‚Ç¨584 million versus my guidance of approximately ‚Ç¨600 million or slightly below.",0
"Net of some new adjustments for case volume above budget, we expect a positive annual effect of about ‚Ç¨10 million for HELIOS's sales and EBIT.",1
"I had no visibility of the dollar's strength that kicked in about three months ago, that combined, had led to an even stronger mitigation than expected.",1
"For reported growth, we also saw the negative foreign exchange effect run out of steam, down to one point and that is where I expect it to stay also for the full year.",-1
"Furthermore, the latest figures versus peers confirm that BBVA Bancomer is still the clear market leader, gaining market share in lending and maintaining it in customer funds, and it is also the leader in efficiency and profitability, and it has solid capital adequacy.",1
I'd like to come back to that important distinction between forming and mature generics I was talking about our Q3 call.,1
"Revenue contributions from these launches will be primarily in 2017, but they will also help mitigate the effects of an assumed further gradual normalization of drug shortages later this year, as well as potentially increased competition in some of our larger molecules.",-1
"If we look at the net interest income or the operating income, they're falling around 19%, and these are significantly affected, first of all, by the deleveraging that we've just seen, but secondly, by the effect of the floor clause of the mortgages.",0
"And so in Q3, that effect was around ‚Ç¨10 million or approximately 4 percentage points of EBIT growth and somewhat masked the excellent underlying development.",1
"The return on tangible equity for the year was 6.6%, this should clearly be going up as we have made return on capital one of our six strategic priorities that I shared with you in prior presentations.",1

"This is what we call the Digital Workplace, which includes functionalities such as a complete view, 360 view of the client, the ability to communicate with clients digitally, to send them business proposals or signing documents.",0
"Both of these effects, though, are positive for our business and they're positive for our P&L going forward, but they do have a negative impact on the Core Equity Tier 1 fully-loaded ratio because of the higher value of our exposure to U. S. dollar risk-weighted assets and because of the mark-to-market of the available-for-sale sovereign portfolios.",-1
"We're working in a different way, project-based, much more dynamic, much more collaborative, people from different departments working together, much more results-oriented.",1
"This gets reflected in our new HELIOS full-year EBIT guidance, which includes the acquired Rh√∂n facilities for the first time.",0
"So at constant currency, Q2 EBIT is down by only 5% and that is a major improvement from the minus 13% in Q1.",-1
"In Turkey, as I already mentioned, all the figures that we show here are shown excluding the increase in the stake for comparison purposes.",1
"Looking at the underlying trends, net interest income grew steadily at 5.5%, and the quarter was also good in fees and commissions, growing at 6.1%, and both items are, of course, very core to support our earnings.",1
"And in efficiency, this is what I was alluding to before, better trend in both revenues and in costs, which is improving the efficiency level.",1
"So, we're accelerating sales on the one hand, and on the other hand is we're managing the non-performing loans that are still on the balance sheet, that's related to the real estate business, but ‚Äì and most of which are individuals Eurasia.",0
"It will be possible for us to have greater visibility for future NPAs and expect to have fewer new entries, new additions into the nonperforming loan book.",-1
"Revenues, as you can see on this slide, net interest income performance is excellent, double-digit growth, 18.8% in current terms, 12.4% in constant terms.",1
"Overall, this has been a very good year for Bancomer, which made more than ‚Ç¨1.9 billion in net income and growth close to 11%.",1
It would be 50.5% without the CNCB capital gains and that's clearly better than the average for our peers which is 68.2%.,1
"And finally, in terms of the takeaways, I would say that we have really a strong start to the year with growth in core revenues, with cost control in all of the businesses, with low cost of risk, strong capital generation, also accelerated real estate divestitures, then progressing strongly in our transformation as we had last year as well.",1
"Last May, the CPI referenced the right to calculate the NII contribution from the linkers was increased from 7% to 9%.",1
"At this time, we would also like to share with you a pro forma calculation of our capital ratio, including the estimated impact of IFRS 9, which now stands at minus 31 basis points.",0
"Let me now share some examples of how this is all happening, starting with one, which is illustrated with what we're doing in Spain, for example, where we see how digital sales are driving the significant increase in total sales.",1
"We had a solid loan growth in 2017, in line with expectations, explained by the growth rates in the TL portfolio, over 20%.",1
"Also, on improving efficiency with costs slightly down in 2018, and maintaining a strong risk profile with sustainable cost of risk at around 30 basis points.",1
"As Tidjane has already summarized, at our Investor Day in October of 2015, we had originally intended to raise between CHF 2 billion and CHF 4 billion from the minority IPO of Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG in the second half of 2017.",0
"The CET1 component of this leverage ratio stood at 3.8% at the end of the second quarter, which also exceeds the 2020 Swiss TBTF requirements, which is a going concern level of 3.5% or greater.",-1
"The Data Innovation Lab is a great way for us to access new technologies, hire the skills and the people we did not necessarily have or have enough of.",1
"Fundamentally, we are driving return on capital higher, which should allow in due course, increased return of capital to shareholders.",1
"We've given you the constant FX number, which are more reflective of the underlying dynamics, 4% revenue increase, 5% cost decrease, very nice, again, positive growth, which support the growth of our profits.",1
"We invested ‚Ç¨22 billion, at an average rate of 2.9% of which the eurozone is at ‚Ç¨3 billion (sic) [3%] (28:31).",0
"As we enter 2018, our operating cost base has been reduced by CHF 3.2 billion at constant FX rates or CHF 3.6 billion at actual FX rates.",1
"And I'd note, with regard to net new assets, we did suffer the usual mortgage repayment from the fourth quarter, but unlike in prior fourth quarters, other net inflows was sufficient to fully offset these mortgage payments.",-1
"Now, in Asset Management, PTI increased by 33% to CHF 381 million in 2017, and that included a 25% year-on-year growth to CHF 135 million in the fourth quarter.",1
"It's a reflection of a combination of two things, good investment performance and a stronger distribution footprint, even if we think that there ‚Äì some progress remains to be done.",1
"We saw continuing momentum in the Investment Banking business in Switzerland with good deal flow in M&A, ECM and DCM.",1
"And in Hong Kong as well, because you remember that we had very high sales in Q1 last year, following the regulatory change, and in France, minus 14% due to the global environment and the poor environment of the equity markets.",-1
"The second area, where we are focused has been to generate profitable quality growth in our chosen markets and activities.",1
"We reduced leverage exposure by CHF 4 billion in the first quarter, driven by portfolio wind-downs, asset sales, and a spinoff.",0
"If you look at the transformation over the last two years, you will see that this semester reflects the fact that this is well on track.",0
"In Asset Management, net new asset inflows improved to CHF 5 billion, with a strong contribution from both our joint venture with ICBC in China, as well as from fixed income products in the quarter.",1
"This quarter reduction risk-weighted assets, coupled with the growth in CET1 capital improve the look-through CET1 ratio to 11.8%, up from 11.4% at the end of the first quarter.",1
"We made strong progress on all these objectives while at the same time taking a number of strategic measures both at the group level and in our two divisions, to continue transforming our business for the changing environment.",1
In the fourth quarter we achieved revenues of CHF 6.1 billion and pre-tax income of CHF 1.5 billion from our strategic businesses with a cost-to-income ratio of 75%.,1
"But I would like you to be clear, though, that this is separate from and an addition to the non-strategic run-off.",0
"As you know, Credit Suisse today already has a holding company structure in place and a year ago we announced our plan to further evolve our legal entity structure in line with regulatory requirements.",0
Clearly applying the results in leverage of CHF 1.05 trillion to the total capital of CHF 47.9 billion would enable us to achieve our Swiss total capital leverage target of 4.5% by the end of 2015.,1
"We continue to invest in building our advisory capabilities in IBCM, and a rebound in equity underwriting volumes in the quarter was offset by weaker IBCM volumes given market uncertainties.",-1
"We did see some pickup in equity underwriting revenues compared to third quarter, primarily attributable to our strength in followups.",1
"In the Private Banking & Wealth Management strategic business lines, we achieved a cost-to-income ratio of 68% in 2014, compared to 70% in 2013.",1
"Net new asset inflows of CHF12 billion for the quarter improved significantly compared to CHF6.8 billion last quarter, and the net outflow that we saw in the first quarter of 2012.",1
"Compared to the previous quarter, the decline in revenues mainly reflected seasonally lower client activity after a strong second quarter.",-1
"For the Investment Banking division, the non-strategic unit will be an extension of the existing fixed income wind-down strategy plus a number of additions to the portfolio.",0
Return on regulatory capital was 19% for the strategic business calculated using a 3% CET1 leverage ratio and that compares to 18% on an equivalent basis in the first quarter of 2014.,0
"And as this core profitability increases, which for the first half of 2018 reached 15%, and as the drag of the SRU ‚Äì not sure why it's in pink, but it's in pink at the bottom ‚Äì as the drag from the SRU diminishes, we are well positioned to generate profitable growth and create value going forward.",1
"And I'd note that the continued reduction of risk-weighted assets in the SRU means it is now below the target of $11 billion in risk-weighted assets, excluding operational risk that we originally said we'd meet by the end of 2018.",0
We're very pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter with earnings per share up 13% primarily driven by growth in our Interactive Consumer Products and Parks and Resorts businesses.,1

"At Studio Entertainment, we delivered another strong quarter with operating income up 15% over prior year, driven by increases in theatrical distribution, reflecting the strong performance of Avengers Age of Ultron , Cinderella and Inside Out, partially offset by the performance of Tomorrowland.",1

"At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, lower segment operating income in the quarter was driven by a decrease in merchandise licensing, partially offset by the growth in our Games business due to the performance of Star Wars Battlefront II.",-1
"This groundbreaking movie opened to huge acclaim and record breaking box office, instantly becoming a cultural phenomenon, inspiring people of all ages and breaking down age-old industry myths.",-1
"These businesses have strong relationships and deep respect within the creative community as well as the proven ability to develop, produce and distribute high quality content.",1
We estimate this drove an adverse impact to operating income of $47 million or 4 percentage points on the year-over-year growth rate.,-1

The increase in product cost was primarily due to higher commodity costs and the unfavorable impact of product mix in the quarter.,-1
"And since beginning our share repurchase program in late 2010, we've allocated approximately $393 million to repurchase approximately 46 million shares at an average price of $8.62 per share leading to a net reduction in our share count of approximately 37%.",-1
"As of the end of the second quarter, we have rolled out this offering to four of our Grille locations ‚Äì great items, lobster corn dogs, flatbreads, cheesesteak egg rolls, many more delicious food items and some discounted drinks.",1
"We have also signed a lease for a Del Frisco's Grille in Westwood, Massachusetts, that's a suburb of Boston to the southwest, and again, an affluent suburb.",0
"Our effective tax rate range is being lowered to between 26% and 28% from 29% to 31%, as our tax credits remains fairly consistent in dollar terms, as the largest one is the FICA tip credit.",1
The final research revealed that Del Frisco's Grille's largest customers segments are social scenesters at 29% and experienced spenders at 25%.,0
"We are currently writing up the franchise contract, determining the royalty fees and putting in place and documenting standardized systems and processes while getting the training teams ready to go.",1
"The additional 17th week during the quarter, which included Christmas Day when our restaurants are closed, as well as New Year's Eve, our highest indexing day of the year, contributed $5.8 million to consolidated revenues.",1
"Our GAAP net income included $0.9 million in lease termination cost, $0.8 million in reorganization severance charges and $0.6 million in impairment charges, which totaled $2.3 million on a pre-tax basis.",0
We view the concept as a growth vehicle that can reach a multiple higher than where we stand today with a clearer understanding of our target consumer and only slight adjustments to its current model.,1
"This top line improvement was due to 12 additional operating weeks related to the Orlando, Florida, opening during the third quarter of 2015.",1
"Sullivan's operating expense rose 100 basis points to 49.9% as their brand experienced higher labor cost, primarily due in part to minimum wage increases and higher incentive bonus pay as more restaurants performed to their targets versus the prior year.",-1
"Therefore, on a go-forward basis beginning with Q1, we will discuss our results in comparison to the recast 2017 quarters.",0
The guidance I'm about to share also makes no assumptions with regards to strategic alternatives to Sullivan's Steakhouse nor repurchases of our common stock under the new authorization.,0
"With me here today are Mark Mednansky, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Pennison our Chief Financial Officer, and Jeff Carcara, our Chief Operating Officer.",0
"We currently have no outstanding debt and expect to continue financing our capital requirements for development, maintenance and remodeling, primarily through cash provided by operations and, if necessary, minimal borrowings under our credit facility.",1
"Turning to our cost structure, cost of sales as a percentage of revenue improved by 10 basis points to 30.2% from 30.3% in the year-ago period, as we benefited from a blended 1.7% price increase taken early in the fourth quarter, an improvement in Sullivan's cost of sales, the natural portfolio hedge provided by the Grille's growing weight on the restaurant portfolio, and the improvement of the Grille's cost of sales relative to the previous year.",1
"With no Grille openings this year until late Q2, we have ample time to refine and solidify our implemented initiatives.",-1
"Our trade ‚Äì our traction in these areas is not only indicative of the health of the business guests but also our own emphasis on marketing, improving our private dining menu offerings in our internal management systems and processes.",0
"We may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are described in our press release and also available on Dine Brands' Investor Relations website.",0
"Applebee's has approximately 7 million fans on Facebook and received Facebook's smartest storyteller award for the third quarter of 2014, when compared to over 60,000 brands on Facebook.",0
"And as a reminder, our free cash flow guidance reflects non-recurring cash payments totaling approximately $10 million related to deferred gains from the repurchase of our debt, primarily in 2008 and 2009, approximately $6 million in cash payments related to our restaurant support center consolidation, and the impact of fiscal 2016 containing 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2015.",1

"It was also a year of achieving corporate milestones, from key hires to the implementations of our strategic consolidation, to securing promising international development agreements to further build our pipeline.",1
The decrease in shares outstanding from the prior year period is due primarily to the repurchase of shares offset by the exercise of stock options.,-1
"It will be held on February 8, 2018 at Fenway Park in Boston, with more details forthcoming at a later date.",0
"We launched a highly successful recapitalization transaction, carried a series of meetings across the U. S. with the entire Dunkin' Donuts system to gain alignment around our multi-year plan to transform Dunkin' Donuts into a beverage-led On-The-Go brand and dealt with the impact of devastating hurricanes through which our franchisees and Dunkin' Brands united to support the communities where we live and operate.",1
"The launch of Dunkin' K-Cups in retail is nationwide as a result of our agreement with the J. M. Smucker Company and Keurig Green Mountain is off to a fantastic start, and Paul who of course runs that business, will address this later in his comments.",1
"We now expect Dunkin' U. S. net development to be at the low end of the previously provided range of 430 to 460 net new restaurants, excluding Speedway self-service coffee station closures.",0
"More than 80% of the Dunkin' Donuts stores are franchisees built in 2013 had a drive-thru, making it even easier for guests to use our brand every day.",1
"The increase in shares outstanding is due primarily to the exercise of stock options, offset by the repurchase of 648,000 shares during 2013.",1
"On a pro forma basis, or excluding the cash still on the balance sheet from the re-lever, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio would be closer to 5.8 to 1.",0
"Again, we do not anticipate any significant additional profit this year from the K-Cup deal for the balance of the year.",0
Adjusted operating income increased $10.1 million or 11.3% from the third quarter of 2013 as a result of the increase in revenues and the write-downs related to the Spain joint venture recorded in the prior-year period.,1
"This 16% increase in EPS year-over-year was driven by both the decline in shares outstanding, as well as the increase in adjusted net income.",1
"For many years in addition to his financial role, he has been actively involved in the day-to-day operations of the restaurants for both Dunkin' and Baskin.",0
"Now moving to third quarter performance for Dunkin' U. S., Systemwide sales grew 4.6% and comparable store sales grew 1.3% in the third quarter.",0
And also engaging the media in interesting campaigns like pizza on a bus and pizza on a train which attract significant coverage in the newspapers and add another layer of interest to the brand.,1
I think the most encouraging thing about Germany is the fact that all the Joey's franchisees have decided to convert.,1
"These investments have paid back, on an individual store basis, in less than 12 months and will be an enduring feature to stimulate further growth in our network.",1
"We announced in December a strategic partnership in Germany, giving us the opportunity to participate in a 200-store chain with DPE, the Australian master franchisee.",1
"Just to touch on the non-underlying, the share of German conversion cost is our share, the 33% share of the joint venture associate investment we have with DPE where we acquired Joey's during the year and we converted all the stores ahead of time by mid-December and that's reflecting our after-tax share of that.",0
"We're delighted with the performance of our new website, and you can see on here two headlines numbers, which demonstrate the reasons why our sales have grown online by 30%.",1
A combination of the squeeze on discretionary spending and the degree of market maturity mean that this year that growth has slowed to around 11%.,-1
"We didn't export our e-commerce platform from the UK and our pricing undercut independent competitors, which merely encouraged them to go even lower.",-1
But the first thing I wanted to point out is that our transition ‚Äì is really around our transition from corporate stores to franchisees.,0
"So to conclude the financial section of the presentation, sales and profit growth has been excellent, especially after removing certain one-off items.",1
"And the Domino's approach to driving delivery, value and focusing on service is resonating strongly with Norwegian customers and we've had a particularly good winter in Oslo with delivery where we've seen huge growth in demand for delivery.",1
"Thereafter, as one can see, the bigger capital expenditure will be on the new UK supply chain center, the new commissaries in the UK and the new commissary in Germany, which will only start in 2016 new, and new stores and supply chain center in Switzerland as well over that period.",0
So we'll continue to invest and continue to excel in supply chain which makes us very different from other operators in the market.,0
"Again, I can list ‚Äì I can go through these key actions, but I won't go through the slide in detail but that provide a reference document for our plans, which are designed not just to build the brand to the next level, but ensure that in the second half the financial performance improves significantly.",1
"But we are well advanced with the recruitment of an interim, which will take the pressure off the appointment of a permanent CFO and allow the chosen permanent CFO to serve any notice as they may need to without putting us under any pressure.",0

"Globally, we estimate we're at a run rate of approximately $4 billion in digital sales annually, which definitely reinforces this tech-to-table notion and indicates to us that continued investment around technology is the right strategic move for us.",0
"The increase this quarter was comprised of franchisee same-store sales, which were up 12.8% and company-owned stores, which were up 12.5%, and this was due primarily to strong order growth.",1
"The drivers of this growth included domestic same-store sales, which rose 6.2% in the quarter, lapping a positive 2% in the first quarter of 2012.",1
"The strength was due to the basics that we've been proven out over in country after country, offer great products at a good value and with excellent service.",1

Please note that these investments are partially offset by fees that we received for digital and credit card transactions from our franchisees that are not included in this G&A number.,0
"As always, we will continue to evaluate the most effective means for deploying our excess cash to the benefit of our shareholders.",1

"Stan, in a familiar Domino's story, started as a driver of more than 30 years ago and worked his way up through the company.",0
There is limited coverage be on the second quarter in part because we believe some of the commodities we experienced cost declines from current levels and we want to be in a position to benefit from that decline and in part because we feel the premiums for future contracts are simply too great compared to what we expect prices will be in a cash market several months from now.,1
"And should, as expected,  the separation take the form of a spinoff, Brad Richmond, who's been Darden's CFO for nearly seven years will be Chief Financial Officer of the new Red Lobster.",0
"At Red Lobster, restaurant expenses for the third quarter were approximately 140 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis, due to sales deleverage and increases in Workers' Compensation and public liability cost.",-1
"Certainly the launch of a comprehensive brand Renaissance plan to regain momentum at Olive Garden, was highlighted by continued success at LongHorn Steakhouse where same restaurant sales exceeded the industry by nearly 4 percentage points and at our Specialty Restaurant Group, which has grown to $1.2 billion in sales.",1
During the past two years these efforts have been supplemented with broad-based cost reduction initiatives due to more than anticipated muted sales growth recovery since the financial crisis and the economic downturn.,-1
"As a result, our annual earnings per share on an adjusted basis were $2.63 a share, which was an increase of 54% versus last year.",1
"First, the ""Create Your Own Tour of Italy"" promotion inspired by one of our most popular core menu items allowed guests to create their own entree by choosing from many of their favorite dishes.",1
"Additionally, we will continue to invest in menu enhancements and reallocating labor as we further simplify operations and optimize our media spending.",1
These results were partially offset by 170 basis points of incremental rent and other taxes related to the real estate transactions.,0
"All other aspects of our fiscal 2017 outlook remain unchanged, including our same-restaurant sales growth outlook of between 1% and 2%.",1
"In fact, it is the undisputed leader on value perception and intent to recommend, which are both leading indicators of same-restaurant sales growth.",1
Segment profit is now comparable to last year as the impacts of the real estate transactions are now in both years' results.,0
"In addition to meaningful sales and earnings growth at our legacy brands, we further increased our scale with the Cheddar's acquisition.",1
"We know we're throwing a lot at the restaurant teams and we know it's distractive, but we're confident the long-term benefit will be worth the short-term impact this is having on the business.",1
Our operations team led by Kelli Valade continues to deliver a better dining out experience as evidenced by our record high guest satisfaction scores.,1
We believe the completion of these transactions positions us with a more optimal capital structure while maintaining an overall strong financial foundation for executing our strategic initiatives.,1
"Just to recap, while Q1 was choppy and below our expectations, our initiatives are delivering share gains, generating stronger comp sales as we enter Q2, and are expected to build sequentially through the year with new capabilities and offerings.",1
"Dining rooms did well, and together with delivery and takeout, offset some of the softness we were seeing in banquets.",0
Our commitment is to leverage the foundation we've built and to take bolder actions we know will make a difference in this environment.,0
"In December, we completed the implementation of local craft beers and our signature Presidente Margarita on Tap, and they're already contributing to record high alcohol mix.",1
"We delivered positive comp sales of 3.7%, primarily driven by a 2% lift in traffic before we adjust for the holiday shift.",1

My Chili's Rewards ended the year with 5.5 million members and 20% member engagement as measured by the number of guest checks that have logged in with a reward account.,1
"And while these factors did create challenges for us during the quarter, we believe the key to regaining momentum lies within our control, specifically the quality and value of the experiences we promote and deliver to our guests.",-1
Our hourly and manager turnover is significantly better than the industry and we're growing our top-performing hourly team members into top-performing operators.,1
"As I mentioned last quarter, we plan to continue to communicate the core Good Times brand tenets of fresh, all-natural handcrafted positioning.",1
"We made several small price adjustments, product specification adjustments, and purchasing changes during the quarter that yielded additional gains in December, and those will be more fully captured for the balance of the fiscal year.",1
"So we hope to accelerate our same-store sales trends through really a three-pronged approach at Bad Daddy's, around lunch and happy hour transactions, happy hour comprising five to six hours of the day.",-1
"We had strong sales in January, but we saw negative same-store sales in February which we attributed primarily to the Winter Olympics and to a lesser extent to the timing of Lent with Easter weekend which is particularly soft weekend for Bad Daddy's, falling in the last week of the second quarter versus early in the third quarter for fiscal 2017.",-1
"But Arizona ended up passing a 40% increase in their tip credit minimum wage and that takes effect on January 1, along with passing a requirement  (06:53) 40 hours of paid sick time for every full-time equivalent employee, and that's a huge whack.",1
"Jim will speak to it in more detail and quantify it, but our biggest challenge I think along with the rest of the industry is the labor environment and the impact of both the shipping legislative initiatives at the state level and simply the supply of available hourly employing labor pool.",-1
"We expect to have both of those tests completed, refined, and evaluated by the end of this first fiscal quarter, again, with the goal of driving guest traffic in our off-peak day parts and implementation in the select stores.",1
"Our weighted product cost index at Good Times increased over 9% during the fiscal year last year and that's the rate of increase that we've only seen twice before in the last 15 years or so, so it was an extraordinary spike during the last seven months.",1
"We recorded a noncash impairment charge for one of our Good Times restaurants of $219,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017.",-1
"We believe we're on track to build some significant value for our shareholders, and as you're probably aware or maybe aware, two of our existing directors filed an amendment to their Form 13-D, suggesting a partial new board slate, along with some strategic initiatives and a focus on improved near-term profitability with an evaluation of the productivity of all of our existing assets.",1
"In the third quarter, we introduced two limited-time menu offerings, a grilled chicken salad with raspberry vinaigrette in the first part of the quarter and a Roasted Garlic Portabella Double Charburger in the second part of the quarter.",0
"We are particularly pleased with our comparable sales growth during this quarter, given the significant hurdle of 12.6% from Q1 of 2015 resulting in a two-year stack comp sales growth of 14.6%.",1
We finished the third quarter with 152 company-operated locations and eight franchised/licensed locations for a total of 160 system-wide locations.,0
"In terms of our liquidity and balance sheet, as of December 30, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $49.5 million and outstanding debt of $2.5 million, which consists solely of our deemed landlord financing.",1
"And while we are always working to further differentiate and evolve the Habit brand, I would like to highlight the strategic initiatives that we are currently working on that are particularly relevant given the current operating environment.",0

"As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization increased slightly to 5% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 4.7% in the second quarter of 2015.",-1
"Based on our growth plans, we believe, expected cash flows and current cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our capital needs for the next several years.",1
"We now expect the total revenue will be between $284 million and $286 million, compared to our previous guidance of between $286 million to $290 million; an increase in comparable restaurant sales between 2% to 2.5% for the full year adjusted slightly from our prior guidance of approximately 3%.",1
These initiatives include keeping our menu fresh and interesting via highly successful food-based promotions and initiatives to drive guest drive traffic through special occasion offerings such as Valentine's Day surf and turf promotion.,1
"With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Christi, who will take us through the financials for the second quarter.",0
"Our comp base units grew sales by 320 basis points this quarter, which came on top of a 310 basis point increase in Q4 of last year.",1
"This will mark our third location in the DFW market and our Dallas North Tollway and Parker site puts us in the sweet-spot of the economically strong northeastern part of the DFW metroplex, where there's an attractive mix of residential and commercial growth to go with notable sporting and other entertainment options.",1
"Cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased 30 basis points to 27%, compared to 27.3% last year.",-1
This compares to a provision for income taxes of $3.8 million and an effective tax rate of 40.9% in the prior-year first quarter.,0

"While the initial uptake from customers has been modest, we believe that delivery can be a sales driver in the future.",0
"System-wide comparable restaurant transactions were flat to the quarter and in terms of cadence, we experienced an uptick in both comparable sales and transactions in September.",0
"During the first quarter, our income from continuing operations before special items declined $88,000 compared to last year's adjusted income from continuing operations before special items of $514,000.",0
"This positive comp was primarily driven by same-store sales growth at our two primary brands Luby's Cafeteria, which was up 1.5% and Fuddruckers, which was up 0.6%.",1
"Switching to our Culinary Contract Service segment, revenue grew significantly in the first quarter, and remains on track to show substantial growth in the year 2018.",1
"Despite this decline, Culinary segment profit was 10.5% of culinary sales in the quarter, compared to 10.2% in the second quarter last year.",1
"Including Cheeseburger, store level profit, and that number, we were in total for the segment 14.8% this year versus 15% last year.",0
The decrease in EBITDA was primarily the result of a $4.5 million reduction in store-level profit due to lower sales with higher food and labor cost.,-1
"We exceeded our new restaurant development goals in fiscal 2014 by opening a total of 15 restaurants, 12 were new restaurant locations and three were locations we converted from Cheeseburger in Paradise restaurants into Fuddruckers restaurants.",0
"Now despite the cost pressures for the year, I'd like to highlight the performance at our core Luby's Cafeteria brand.",1
"As a reminder, our first quarter has historically been a seasonally weaker quarter with lower guest traffic in the period after the start of school but before the Thanksgiving holiday.",-1
The teams worked tirelessly to get all of our restaurants cooking again so we could feed the communities that we love and serve.,0
"Before proceeding, I'd like to mention that second quarter results for 2016 represent a 12-week period from December 17 to March 9.",0
"And we've also seen new challenges emerge in the marketplace, like softer retail sales in the U. S. and the avian influenza outbreak in Asia.",-1
"In addition to our ongoing emphasis on menu, these include brand extensions like the McCaf√© beverages, dessert kiosks and delivery.",0
"Similar to Don, I will depart from the usual approach to my prepared remarks and instead of walking through the income statement, I'll begin by discussing the four most significant factors impacting quarterly results.",0
We're acting with a sense of urgency as these steps are critical to addressing current performance and to advancing our longer term strategies.,0
It started with fundamental improvements in our marketing efforts and across our entire menu and it was enabled by much stronger alignment with our franchisees.,1
"Notably lower than the 2013 increase of about 3%, and lower than food away from home inflation, which ended the year at 3%.",1
"Today, I would like to begin by discussing the performance factors that impacted our first quarter results, including the strategic charges taken in the quarter.",0
Then I'll provide updates on key financial metrics and close with some final thoughts about our path to realizing our long-term potential.,0
This year we've given customers even more reasons to visit our restaurants with the rollout of a new Value Menu at breakfast and through effective marketing and promotional efforts including Monopoly.,1
"As we roll out self-order kiosks, table service, and the mobile app, we're providing customers with more choice and flexibility, as we make progress towards McDonald's Experience The Future.",1
"In addition, we're expanding our delivery business by tapping into growing digital channels as well as other vendors to offer added convenience to Chinese customers.",0
"By staying keenly focused on our customers, we maintain positive momentum while continuing to make meaningful strides towards building a better McDonald's.",1
"Leveraging Doug's experience to help blend in with the newer experience of Chris, we're all one team, and that's a good balance.",0
If you could just share a little bit more on the macro thoughts with what you're seeing not just in China and the Asian region and the U. S. but also Europe?,0
"We're taking significant steps forward on what matters most to customers, and I'm confident it will make a difference for our business and our brands.",1
"In Canada, customers have come to rely on the hospitality provided by our guest experience leaders, who welcome them in the restaurants and offer to guide them through the kiosk ordering process.",0
And then my real question is on the initiative to roll out fresh beef in the Quarter Pounder in the U. S.,0
"We continue to improve the model as we scale, remaining on track to offer delivery in 10,000 total restaurants by the end of the year.",1
"Whilst we continue to expand the base of participating restaurants, we're working closely with Uber Eats and our other partners to optimize the model building awareness, trial and more frequent repeat orders, and most importantly, customer and courier satisfaction.",1
"We've set goals to reduce packaging and increase recycling, take bold actions relating to kid's nutrition and support producers in developing more sustainable approaches to rating beef.",-1
"As Steve mentioned, the U. S. is modernizing at an unprecedented pace, transforming over 3,000 restaurants to date in 2018 alone and expecting to surpass our original target of about 4,000 projects this year.",1
"I believe in the people I work alongside in serving the greater than 60 million guests we serve every year, and I believe in our ability to overcome this cycle that we're in.",-1
"We recognize that many of the restaurants that are underperforming have a substantial hurdle to overcome, will require a significant amount of resources to turnaround.",-1
"Given the timing of the closures that we just completed, we anticipate a roughly $5 million to $5.5 million benefit to 2017's adjusted EBITDA relative to fiscal year 2016 from these 39 restaurants.",-1
"Catering accounted for 1.3% of sales in Q1, 40 basis points above prior year in a quarter that historically is lower from a catering seasonality perspective.",0
"And lastly, I'm pleased and confident with the teams' continued focus, objectivity, intensity and ability to remain persistent towards executing our shared expectations and making improvements.",1
"As many of you know, earlier this year, we introduced new Your World Kitchen positioning and made corresponding enhancements in our merchandising and internal signage to reflect that positioning.",0
"While we will continue to make every dish to order, online ordering serves as a throughput equalizer for our teams and for our guests.",0
"Our limited time offers have been a staple of our menu strategy over the past several years, reinforcing to our guest our commitment to fresh ingredients, such as asparagus, as well as our promise of preparing ingredients throughout the day.",0
"Our brand strength continued to resonate with our guests, and our brand positioning for the future remain the right platform for our continued growth.",1
Kevin and Keith outlined the strength of our pipeline and our operating cash flow and borrowing capacity is more than sufficient to meet our development plans.,1
This document contains and identifies important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or our forward-looking statements.,0
"Redefining the brand experience and affirming our position as the authority on noodles and pasta, broadening our scope with Zoodles, investing in opportunities to provide added convenience for our guests, including quick pick-up, online ordering and delivery, refining our economic model, and developing future leaders throughout our organization, all of these efforts together will allow Noodles to ultimately become one of the premier concepts in the fast-casual space.",1
"The largest factor distinguishing our highest performing restaurants has ultimately been our level of brand awareness and during the third quarter, we made investments in both catering and marketing initiatives that will help build that awareness over the long term.",1
"While many of these messages have been more brand-driven in nature, I am very pleased that our early read has shown improvements in traffic terms, especially given the improvements have come at a time of a slowdown in the broader industry.",1
Now I'd like to turn it over to Dave to give an update on our development strategy and discuss financial results.,0
"Our research has indicated that over the years, the brand has become a bit too serious and our communication a bit too broad.",-1
"As Kevin mentioned, we have seen increased momentum thus far in Q3 with comparable restaurant sales at positive 1.3% through yesterday, August 12.",1
"During the second quarter, the company received the final assessment from the third of three payment card companies the real assessments related to our 2016 data breach.",0
"We formally announced the promotion of Melissa Heidman as our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, as well as the recent hiring of Ken Kuick, as our Chief Financial Officer.",0
"Operating expenses is 10.2% in the quarter, an improvement of 20 basis points as compared to the prior year due to better liability insurance and leverage and utility costs.",1
"Onto labor, labor was 28.9% for the quarter which was an increase of about 70 basis points from the prior year.",1
This repetitive learn and roll approach has given us valuable learnings on how we begin to utilize marketing as an engine of growth.,1
We continue to test across our markets and the data we capture will be invaluable as we become more targeted in our offers going forward.,0
"And as Aylwin mentioned, 37 days of the 91 days or roughly 40% in the quarter were negatively impacted by either extreme cold temperatures and/or snowfall.",-1
"However, renewal rates are adjusting to new market levels and we are also incurring some higher reassessments of real estate taxes, which are expected to continue to offset that leverage.",-1
"We also remain very committed to our long-term growth targets, which include total shops growth of at least 10% each year, low to mid-single-digit comparable same-store sales growth, shop level profit margin of at least 20%, adjusted net income of at least 20%, and return on new shop investment of 25% or greater.",1
"We recently rolled out 21 additional shops for breakfast, which brings our breakfast total to 92 shops or 29% of our system.",0
"And yesterday, we launched our premium Cuban sandwich, which features slow-roasted pulled pork, smoked ham, melted Swiss cheese, pickle, and Potbelly mustard.",0
Our shop-level margin for the first quarter was 16.4% of company-operated sales as compared to 17.8% in the prior year period.,-1
"During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 334,000 shares of Potbelly common stock in the open market for a total of approximately $4.4 million.",0
"We believe our strong culture and our core values provide us with the foundation to effectively execute our growth strategies, leverage our top line, trends and increase flow through to the bottom line.",1
Our results in the second quarter of 2015 were better than 2014 and therefore the shop level bonus amounts this year have been higher.,1
Our performance demonstrates our ability to meaningfully drive traffic through investments and resources that we have dedicated which we believe are building the foundation to drive improved traffic and profitability over the long term.,1
"These openings will skew towards the first half of the fiscal year, large format stores and existing markets for our brand.",0
Most of you know that Brian and I have been the face of Dave & Buster's to the investment community since we went public in 2014.,0
"Food and beverage cost as a percentage of food and beverage sales was 60 basis points higher compared to last year, as the unfavorable impact of commodity inflation, the impact of our newer stores and investment in our new Angus burger was only partially offset by the favorable impact of food and beverage pricing.",-1
"EBITDA is now expected to range between $276 million and $282 million, representing a $5 million increase at the top end of the range, and we are projecting net income of $107 million to $111 million based on an effective tax rate of 34.5% to 35%.",1
"By the end of fiscal year 2017, we'll have 104 stores operating across 35 states in Puerto Rico, and that's just under half of our long-term goal.",0
"Additionally, the underwriters exercised an option to purchase an additional 1.275 million shares of common stock at the offering price.",1
Their passion and dedication to the brand is the key reason for our continued success and why I'm more excited today about our future prospects than ever before.,1
"Menu innovation continues to be a hallmark of our brand, and our guests have responded favorably to recent introductions such as Carnivore Pizzadilla and Smoked Turkey Melt, as well as several new one-of-a-kind cocktails.",1
"The assortment consists of RFID bracelets, pendants and wands, and guests can purchase these in place of a Power Card to activate our games.",0
We now project comp store sales on a comparable 52-week basis to be down low-single digits versus previous guidance of low-to-mid-single digits decline.,-1
"We're delighted that the flow-through from our robust comparable store sales along with strong revenue contributions from newer stores has enabled us to set a new bar performance for Store-level EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margins during the third quarter.",1
Let's now review our third quarter results and then discuss our increased outlook for 2015 and preliminary thoughts on 2016.,1
"Breaking down the 6% increase in comp, amusements rose 8.5%, food sales increased 3.6%, while our bar business grew 3.2%, where our combined food and beverage increased to 3.5%.",1
"So, needless to say, we were very pleased to have accomplished this as it leaves us well positioned to execute our long-term growth strategy.",1
"Of the 21 closures, 18 are non-traditional locations which, by their nature, can be more volatile due to the short-term contracts under which these stores operate, especially in colleges and universities.",-1
"At Pizza 73 operating largely in Alberta where retail sales can be influenced by the price of oil, same-store sales decreased 5.3% for the quarter.",-1
"The company's working capital reserve is CAD 5.1 million at December 31st, which is a slight decrease of CAD 119,000 since December 31st of 2016.",-1
"Pizza Pizza Royalty Corp., which consolidates the Partnership into its financial statements, owned 79.6% of the Partnership at December 31, 2016.",0
"Breaking it down a bit, a 6% royalty was earned on CAD 110.8 million of Pizza Pizza restaurant sales for the quarter and 222 million for the six months.",0
"And you can see what's going on there, but we still feel we are well-positioned to be nimble and adapt to our customers as needed in Alberta.",1
The first quarter has a stored base in our softest sales quarter in Q1 royalty gross sales as I said grew 3.6%.,0
"Strategically, at Pizza Pizza in Q1, we continued our focus on increasing restaurant profitability, while also working to drive sales increases.",1
"The slight decrease in same-store sales for Q1 is largely due to a decrease in customer traffic, specifically, a decrease in the number of customers who walked into our stores to order as opposed to those that ordered ahead of time.",-1
"We continue to be the brand leader when it comes to plain Clean Label ingredients by achieving milestones on our promise of better ingredients, better pizza.",1
"Consolidated second quarter revenues decreased $26.8 million or 6.2%, primarily driven by a decline in North America comp sales of 6.1%, and lower North America commissary volumes.",-1
Offsetting the lower North America sales were increases on the International side due to an increase in equivalent units and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of approximately $2.8 million.,1
We repurchased approximately $28 million of stock during the third quarter and have approximately $161 million of remaining share repurchase authorization.,0
"Financial results in our corporate-owned North China market are not improving at the pace we had projected entering 2014, and we currently project profitability in North China to be relatively flat with 2013, excluding the impact of one-time items that impacted the fourth quarter of 2013.",1
"We continue to perform very well in most parts of the world, most notably in the UK, Russia and throughout the Middle East and Latin America.",0
"I congratulate Tony on his promotion, and I am excited that the two of us will continue to work together to drive the company forward.",1
"I witnessed this firsthand during the quarter as members of our leadership team visited several markets throughout Asia, including China, Korea and the Philippines, with a stop in one of our newest markets, Guam.",-1
"As part of this work we are launching diversity equity and inclusion training this month for our 14,000 corporate team members which we expect to be completed in early 2019.",0
We're also excited to have launched our Tims mobile app a few short days ago with our app now open to all of our guests in Canada and the U. S.,1
"In the U. S., we further accelerated comparable sales in the fourth quarter to 5.1%, resulting in full-year comparable sales of 2.5%.",0
"Tim's Canada and Burger King's U. S. comparable store sales growth were 5.4% and 8% respectively, driven by consistent execution of key strategic initiatives which I'll discuss at length.",1
"Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in the press release available on our website.
Before outlining the agenda for today's call, we wanted to briefly highlight the recent implementation of two new accounting standards since both of them impacted our first quarter 2018 results, specifically the two new standards are revenue recognition and hedge accounting.",0
We're proud of the expansion that our partner has been able to achieve in such a short time and we continue to work towards further accelerating that growth in the future.,1
"I'm pleased to report that 2016 was a year in which we achieved strong profitability growth and we accelerated the pace of restaurant development at both of our iconic brands, Tim Hortons and Burger King.",1
"We will continue to focus on improving or exiting underperforming sites in our portfolio of company-owned stores, and we expect to limit capital expenditure in the back half of the fiscal year as we implement performance improvement initiatives.",1
"But like I said, we still have lots to go in 2018 and every month something gets crossed off that we were looking to accomplish and we'll continue to do that throughout this year.",1
"Also as a reminder for comparative purposes results in the second quarter of 2018, compared to 2017 should be positively impacted by Easter weekend, which will not be in Q2, 2018 unlike 2017.",1
"At Recipe, we do not have to look far to see shining examples of how investing in people and partners delivers superior results.",1
"Above all, we believe we have initiatives in the pipeline and the team in place to execute on our strategic plan.",0
"And in fact, we are on track to hit $1 million total raised by the end of this year through sales of our signature Freckled Lemonade, one glass $0.10 at a time to benefit our national charity partner, Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation.",1
"Our improved guest service model is being reinforced by our new labor management system, which creates a labor schedule customized to an individual restaurant's traffic pattern and unique product mix.",1
"All our guests will soon be enjoying burgers on red plates with our famous Bottomless Fries featured in a new and fun way, along with re-energized service components to optimize guest engagement, table side and particularly in the bar.",1
"As you can see on slide 5 and 6, in Q4, we continue to advertise our $6.99 Everyday Value offering of Red's Tavern Double with bottomless fries on television.",0
"Our outlook contemplates a broad but limited improvement in industry traffic, relative to the 2.2% decrease casual dining had in 2014.",1
We'll also be investing in additional restaurant-level technology in 2017 and beyond that will make our restaurants even more efficient and position us well for the future.,1
"By reducing investment where it doesn't matter as much, we can continue to deliver high quality burgers with attentive service and speed at an affordable price.",1
"And I couldn't be more pleased to say there is no one that I believe is better suited to succeed me than, Denny.",0
This much needed news on our Tavern platform moved us back to beating the competition on traffic as measured by Black Box.,0
This most basic of operating systems long-delayed due to other investment priorities is making a measurable and important difference in speed-to-table.,0
"Moving down the P&L, general and administrative costs are expected to be up to $22 million in the fourth quarter, while selling expenses are expected to be approximately 3.5% of total revenues.",-1
"We continue to explore, pilot, and expand other productivity improvements and service model changes to support to-go and catering through our transformation initiatives.",1
"Thank goodness, I didn't double down on my tattoo bet or I'd be on my way to a full sleeve by now.",-1
As we outlined in our annual guidance the company did not repurchase any shares in the quarter and does not expect to do so in 2017.,0
"At our best, our servers make connections with guests ages 2 to 92 and they do so in a way that ensures loyalty and delivers on our guest up-time promise.",1
"To address this issue, we will vary pricing on our Tavern lineup from now on, we'll add new Tavern Double Burgers less often and likely we'll move another when we do so.",0
"Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our international sales, international comparable sales were up 3% and total franchise comparable sales were up 3.3%.",1
Our marketing focus has transitioned from TV in the fourth quarter to digital efforts in the first half of 2014.,0
This is due to the combined impact of a 1.2% price increase taken in the fourth quarter of 2013 and a 0.8% increase taken in the first quarter of 2014.,1
We remain focused and confident that we can continue this trend with a combination of initiatives that Mike has laid out.,1
"Private dining sales at Ruth Chris Steak House, which we view as a proxy for business demand, grew 12.6% during the quarter, and we are encouraged to see that it continues to exceed our comparable year-over-year store sales growth.",1
"This new authorization replaces the previous $60 million program announced in April of 2016, which had only $12 million of capacity remaining.",0
"Restaurant operating weeks for company-owned Ruth's Chris Steak House restaurants were 819 in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to 879 last year, which included 60 additional operating weeks largely as a result of last year's 14th week.",0
"During the fourth quarter, we added the new menu to seven more company-owned restaurants, bringing the total number of company locations offering the new menu items to 59.",0
We also paid off all of our debt on our senior credit facility down from $3 million at the end of the first quarter.,-1
"I'm delighted to report that our U. S. partners achieved record levels of productivity in Q1, an extraordinary accomplishment given the high volume of customer traffic and thousands of Verissimo demonstrations in our stores during the holiday season.",1
"As Howard  stated, we continue to see strong sales growth in many of our license markets as our partnerships continue to thrive and provide a meaningful contribution to our success.",1
"We are building and deepening our connection to customers in China by continuing to deliver locally relevant innovation including chestnut and peach blossom tea latte, two customer favorite seasonal beverages evocative of the flavors of the Chinese New Year season and actively building My Starbucks Rewards membership.",1
Also contributing to the Q2 profitability was a $5.7 million reduction to the estimated asset retirement obligations of our store leases in the region.,1
Q4 is likely to return to the strong levels we reported in the first half of fiscal 2013 in the range of 5% to 7% global comp growth.,1
Since launch we have sold way over 1 billion K-Cups in 200 million sticks of VIA and we continue to build and expand both platforms.,0
"While many national and international retailers are just beginning to appreciate the critical importance of integrating a mobile platform into their business, Starbucks continues to extend our leadership position by providing the digital services and content our customers truly value and appreciate.",-1
I've worked with Kevin in his role as a Board member for many years and have benefited from his experience and insights.,1
Creating a genuine Starbucks experience for our customers and an authentic and personal connection between our customers and our partners is core to everything we do.,0
"Comparable store sales in EMEA grew 3% in Q3 despite the FX headwinds and macroeconomic challenges in several markets with a 2% increase in traffic, representing its 9th consecutive quarter of positive comp growth with every EMEA market posting positive comps.",1
"In fact, Starbucks ranked 15th on the Alta's  Annual Regional list of Asia's top 1,000 brands for 2015 and has been ranked as the number one restaurant brand in Asia for the fourth year in a row.",0
Starbucks Coffee Company is connecting more deeply with more customers across all day parts and around the world than ever before.,0
"Our fast-growing Americas segment had another very strong quarter posting 9% comp growth, with 4% coming from an increase in traffic.",1
Starbucks roast and ground continues to be the number one premium packaged coffee brand with dollar sales growth of 10% and share growth of 160 basis points to a record 27.3% share for the quarter.,1
"Combined with the strength of the Starbucks brands and the quality of our coffee, we will continue to delight our customers, outpace the category and build upon our leadership position in the market.",1
"We continue to expect consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2016 to increase slightly related to 2015 on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis reflecting strong revenue growth, sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and digital investments.",1
"As many of you know, the last five years Starbucks has built a powerful, sustainable, premium single-serve business, operating on the Keurig K-Cup rails, and today Starbucks has the leading U. S. market share of both premium single-serve and of premium roast and ground and is the leading brand on the K-Cup platform.",1
"The Starbucks single-serve aspirations do not end with North America, nor do they end with K-Cup, and now we have capability in a clear line of sight on a second equally attractive single-serve opportunity.",1
"Finally, with the strong cash flows driven by our record-breaking holiday period, we took
advantage of recent equity market volatility and significantly increased our share buyback activity since the end of Q1.",1
"Our newest China stores continue to deliver record breaking volume and profit, and we remain committed, and we're on plan to increase our store count to over 3,400 in China and to over 10,000 in CAP overall by the end of fiscal 2019.",1
"Moving on to Commodities, with 2016 coffee needs fully priced, we still expect to see a slightly favorable impact for the year, and we are now over 50% price locked for fiscal 2017.",1
"Our decision to aggressively but thoughtfully and strategically expand our portfolio of roasteries is supported by the one-of-a-kind, ultra-premium Reserve experience our roasteries deliver to our customer, and the accelerating outperformance against plan we are experiencing in our Seattle Roastery, where full-year comp sales increased a full 24% over the prior year, thanks in large part to a ticket that has grown to be four times the ticket of a typical Starbucks store.",-1
"Each of our business segments contributed to our overall global results, and I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through our performance by geography and segment.",0
"We entered Q3 with 13.3 million active Starbucks reward members in the US, up 11% year-on-year, and with 36% of total tender coming from Starbucks rewards members.",1
Each of these combinations demonstrate the pursuit of enhancing the physical retail experience with a relevant and complementary digital experience.,1
"While we are pleased that our Americas segment delivered top-line improvement in a difficult retail and consumer environment, we did experience a softening in transaction comps as we moved through the quarter.",1
"By creating distinct production channels utilizing current equipment and labor allocations, this new order production and deployment capability is enabling a throughput to unlock in the stores where we are testing the approach.",1
"Not only are these fast growing platforms highly relevant to our customers, our research demonstrates that they also provide a significant opportunity to drive food attach outside of our core morning day part.",1
"Earlier this year, we surpassed our goal of hiring 10,000 veterans and military spouses, and have now increased our goal to hiring 25,000 by 2025.",1

"Our 2018 G&A will also include our biennial leadership retreat as well as an increase for our new corporate office, training center and test kitchen that Randy mentioned earlier.",0
"Jeff and I want to sincerely thank and applaud our team for making our first year as a public company a remarkable one, one that has set expectations high for us going forward.",0
"Remember, our comparable Shack rates are still very small with only 30 Shacks in the fourth quarter, of which approximately one-third are high-volume Shacks in the Northeast.",0
"Moving on to 2018, which represents another exciting year for Shake Shack, and in many ways, a pivotal one, as we expand at a greater scale than ever before and strengthen our foundation for many more years of growth ahead.",1
We're excited and committed to make this important step effectively and efficiently to scale towards that three-year 200 shack goal and beyond.,1
"Over the next few years, we continue to expect deleverage on the labor line as target model Shacks make up a larger percentage of our base and as minimum wage increases continue to pressure our labor costs.",1
"While we expect these improvements to continue to help us leverage  the line (19:40), we will continue to experience higher distribution costs when we enter new markets, and food costs for those new markets will offset some of these efficiencies.",1
"Starting mid-November, through the end of the year, our Holiday Shake LTO program will return for its second year; this year featuring pumpkin pie, chocolate peppermint, and Christmas cookies at all domestic company-operated Shacks.",0
"Founded by Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group, Shake Shack was created leveraging USHG's expertise and community building, hospitality, fine dining, restaurant operations and the sourcing of premium ingredients.",0

"The net loss in the prior-year period included: impairment and other lease charges of $1.6 million, and acquisition expenses of $0.2 million.",-1
We are evaluating a number of potential transactions and would expect to complete the purchase of additional restaurants in the second half of the year.,0
We are also considering a refinancing of our existing debt in 2015 which could facilitate a more aggressive remodeling plan and/or additional acquisitions.,-1
"Our net loss was $7.4 million, or $0.32 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $5.2 million in the prior year period, or $0.23 per diluted share.",-1
"As Dan said, $1.6 million of this charge was for a reserve for future lease costs at the four acquired restaurants that we closed during the quarter.",-1
"Moving forward, we will continue remodeling restaurants in the normal course, however, we anticipate that the pace of such activities will generally slow from the aggressive remodeling program undertaken over the past few years.",-1
This decrease was primarily due to the 2016 reversal of a $30.4 million valuation allowance or $0.68 per diluted share previously established against our net deferred income tax assets.,-1
"Total restaurant sales increased 7.8% in the first quarter, reflecting our acquisition of almost 100 restaurants since the beginning of last year.",1
Cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales was 197 basis points higher in the third quarter compared to the prior year.,0
"Capital expenditures also include $10 million to $12 million for non-recurring investments in new kitchen production and product holding systems, new training systems and certain POS system upgrades.",0
The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP and a reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures is available in our earnings release.,0
"Kent Taylor, our Founder and CEO, he's had some flight delays today, but we do expect him to be joining us in a bit for the Q&A portion of our call.",-1
"Cost of sales as a percentage of sales improved year-over-year by 106 basis points, benefiting from commodity deflation of approximately 1.9%.",1
"As Kent mentioned earlier, our development pipeline for 2014 is in very good shape not only from a site perspective, but also from a people perspective.",1
"In closing, I want to congratulate Pat Ryan of Thornton, Colorado, for being named our 2014 Managing Partner of the Year at our recent conference in Arizona.",0
Our balance sheet remained strong as we ended the quarter with $114 million in cash and $52 million in debt.,1
"Our plans for those monies include reinvesting in our people through higher compensation and additional benefits, keeping our menu prices aggressive, and returning more cash to shareholders through higher dividends.",1
"For the quarter, restaurant operating profit increased 18.9% or $16.4 million compared to the prior year and restaurant margin dollars per store week were up 9.7%.",1
"Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the year with $95 million in cash, up about $13 million from last year.",1
"And speaking of another competitive advantage, I also want to congratulate our own Chris Jacobson on his recent promotion to Chief Marketing Officer for Texas Roadhouse.",1
Our new back-office tools including actual versus theoretical food cost and labor management are having a positive impact in our corporate restaurants.,1

"While our mix grew by 80 basis points for the entire quarter, we exited the quarter at 19% of total sales.",0
"At the end of September, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $4.6 million and $140 million in debt.",0
"Our company-owned restaurant revenue increased to $8 million from $7.3 million in the prior year, driven entirely by 9.9% growth in same-store sales.",1
The decrease was primarily driven by a 7% decrease in the commodity cost of bone-in chicken wings along with sales leverage and operational efficiencies in both food and labor costs.,-1
Interest expense rose to $1.5 million from $0.7 million in the fourth quarter last year reflecting the refinancing of our credit agreement that was completed at the beginning of the third quarter.,-1
"We believe Wingstop is truly a brand in a category of one, as we lack a true competitor and have multiple long-term sales drivers and a significant amount of white space in front of us for growth.",-1
"I'm confident our China business will bounce strongly and lead the way to restoring our track record of consistently delivering double-digit EPS growth in 2014, 2015 and beyond.",1
"This year we expect these divisions plus India to open about 1,500 new units including over 800 net new units.",1
"Moving to our other international businesses, we expect another solid year of sales growth at YRI, driven by record new unit of at least 1,000 stores in 2013.",1
One of the first things I want to do is to explain the timing of our revised guidance for fourth quarter same-store sales growth in China.,1
"Reported EPS declined 67%, primarily due to a noncash special item charge of $258 million to reflect the partial impairment of Little Sheep intangible assets.",-1
"And along with Pizza Hut home service, we have high intentionality of Little Sheep and East Dawning to participate in the huge Chinese food category down the road.",1
"We're confident we will have a strong bounce-back year in 2014, growing EPS at least 20% and re-establish our track record of consistently delivering double-digit earnings per share growth in years ahead.",1
"We believe it ended up being too much of a niche product to overlap the 15% growth we've had over the past two years with the introductions of the Doritos Locos Tacos and then Cool Ranch, two of the most popular product introductions in the history of our entire category, not just Taco Bell.",1
"We sharpened our focus on value in the United States and have leveraged more competitive offers to drive digital activations, and consumers are responding.",0
"We plan to reinforce Pizza Hut's leadership, quality, innovation, and superior value as we continue to implement a comprehensive turnaround plan.",1
"We are making KFC even more contemporary, have huge upside at breakfast, delivery and late night, and are building off of our best operations in the world.",-1
This is just one example of how we share know how and best practices from teams around the world as we address the setback with a sense of urgency.,-1
"Division operating margin decreased 90 basis point to 22.6%, as strategic growth investments in international G&A offset improved restaurant margins, which benefited from lower cheese costs.",-1
This gives us confidence that the international Pizza Hut business is not far behind the U. S. and its turnaround.,1
"I would like to recognize the work, ethics, and diligence across the organization that enabled to us complete the spinoff on time and with such success.",1
"I'm really happy to reaffirm the long-term targets we set out at our October investor and analyst conference, and I look forward to sharing highlights with you, as we progress.",1
This is particularly the case in international markets where the benefit of reduced expenses tied to refranchising can trail the actual sale of the restaurants.,1
"And with healthy demand from existing new franchisees for our brands around the world, we expect this pipeline to grow.",1
All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors including ‚Äì included in our filings with the SEC.,0
"Again, I want to reiterate, we continue to expect underlying base operating profit growth to be strong and up high single-digits.",1
We are excited for this unique partnership which includes having a seat on the Grubhub board of directors and aligns with Yum!,1
"The significant improvement can be attributed to integrate back of house pack lines from the 2015 acceleration agreement with franchisees focus on value with the $5 Fill Up, $10 Chicken Share and $20 Fill Up and technology improvements to aid operations and Labor deployment.",1
"In April, we successfully re-priced our $1.97 billion Term Loan B, which reduces the interest rate by 25 basis points to LIBOR plus 1.75% and is expected to reduce annual cash interest by approximately $5 million.",-1
System sales growth for the second quarter was 4% with 1% same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth.,1
"First, as Greg mentioned, the American customer Satisfaction index report noted Pizza Hut U. S. is having the highest percentage increase in customer satisfaction scores amongst all restaurant companies.",1
We are extremely proud that we had the opportunity to work with China's National Museum to decorate some of our stores with the Chinese traditional themes and characteristics during the Chinese New Year.,1
"The chart on the right shows the corresponding numbers for system sales and, here again, the overall trend is in the right direction.",0
"In the second quarter, we returned over $110 million to our shareholders, including a cash dividend of $38 million and common stock repurchases of $73 million.",0
"Lapping a 4% decline in Q3 last year, Pizza Hut same-store sales were flat in Q3, with a 3% transaction increase and a negative 3% in ticket average, mainly driven by increase in delivery business.",-1
"The first is seasonal promotions, taking full advantage of the rich cultural heritage of China and the range of festivals that populate the calendar in this country.",1
"While our same-store trends improved sequentially during 2016, we have more work to do to deliver same-store sales growth at Pizza Hut Dining.",1
"Looking ahead into Q3, we are excited to introduce an updated kids menu, bringing more of our fresh ingredients to a new, invigorated kids offering.",1
"Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we have opened five additional restaurants and now expect to open 30 to 31 new company-owned restaurants in 2014.",0
"We continue to believe these initiatives, along with a planned price increase and incremental marketing activities, can support our return to positive comps in the second half of the year.",1
"Additionally, our development team has already signed 11 new leases related to our 2015 development target of 30 to 32 new company-owned restaurants.",0
"Furthermore, this capability opens the door in the longer term for potential delivery opportunities in the dinner day part, where recent customer research confirms our incremental sales growth opportunity at dinner.",1
"We've also filed our 10-Q for the first quarter of 2014 today, and we'd encourage you to review that document at your earliest convenience.",0
"Five additional restaurants have opened since the first quarter ended, bringing our total number of restaurants to 120; 114 company-owned and 6 franchise locations.",0

"The quarter really demonstrated the consistency we're seeing in our strategy which is to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, and I'd highlight a few areas here.",1
I'm going to begin by discussing our strategy and how as a foundation our business operating system drives top-tier financial performance for shareholders.,0
"As an example, in 2016, we're investing heavily in channel investments that will improve growth and penetrating key markets over the next several years.",1
"Growth in aftermarket parts and services, trucks and in Europe trailers drove higher margins and helped to mitigate the impact of the downturn.",1
"In addition to the core strategic investments we're also investing in long-term growth through innovative and differentiated products in areas such as controls for buildings as a resource, intelligent monitoring and self-healing systems just to name a few.",1

"This morning, Nigel, $1.5 billion is what we're seeing, we're targeting to deploy in 2017, and $250 million of that, we've raised.",0
The main thing I'd like to point out on slide number 15 is that our operating margin guidance targets have gone up somewhat to reflect the new pension accounting treatment that moves a portion of the cost from the operating line to the other income and expense line below operating income.,1
"Based on the questions we received leading up to this call, we believe you'll find this approach to be valuable.",1
"Netting out all of these updates, strong revenue and share gain, combined with positive price in productivity has enabled us to not only cover the cost of material inflation and other inflation, it's also enabled us to maintain high levels of investment in our business which helps us maintain our momentum over the long term.",1
"Our transport business continued to demonstrate its diversity and resiliency, posting modest growth in EMEA, Latin America, and Asia, and strong growth in APUs, truck, air, and in the aftermarket business.",1
"We've also had strong demand for upgrades to connected buildings and for energy retrofits to capture the energy efficiency savings from new equipment, controls and diagnostics.",1
"As we consistently execute our strategy, we continue to build a stronger, more sustainable company through the long term, well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns.",1
"While it appears that short-term economic stress has diminished for now, concerns over slow European union growth are weighing on farmer confidence.",-1
"For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter up about $420 million or equal to approximately 33% of prior 12-month sales compared with almost 36% a year ago.",-1
"The 2-point decline in operating margin from 2013 is a result of volume, mix, foreign exchange, and higher production costs, including implementation costs related to Final Tier 4.",-1
"Assuming trend yields, grain production levels are expected to be up in 2014 which would result in lower feed grain prices.",1
"The two-point decline from 2013 is a result of mix, foreign exchange, and higher overhead costs, including implementation costs related to final Tier 4.",-1
Losses remain well below the 10-year average of about 28 basis points and the 15-year average of about 48 basis points.,0
"Technically, that is one point less than we said in our prior guidance with the difference mainly due to foreign exchange.",0
"SA&G expense for the full year was down 5%, with currency translation, pension and OPEB expense, and incentive compensation accounting for most of the change.",-1
"Major changes in agriculture and food markets began occurring sometime around the turn of the century, and that ushered in a dozen or so unparalleled years characterized by strong demand growth, record high prices in farm income, food price spikes, expanded investment in innovation and increased trade.",1
"Net sales were down 24% in quarter, and operating profit was down 58%, due mainly to lower shipment volumes and an unfavorable mix.",-1
"Although the government continues to be supportive of the agriculture sector, recent policy changes related to corn flour prices, reduction of corn stockpiles and a less stringent position on grain's self-sufficiency are causing short-term uncertainty for both domestic and global markets.",-1
"Despite current commodity prices, the industry is experiencing stronger replacement demand for large equipment, while demand for small equipment remains solid.",1
"The rate is a result of a more favorable mix of income, improved profitability outside the US, and structural changes within the business.",1
"On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 1 point, a slightly favorable sales mix, and savings related to the voluntary employee separation program.",1
This is due in large part to our ongoing success developing a more durable business model and a wider range of revenue sources.,1
"This is primarily driven by strong industry fundamentals in Brazil, which is offsetting weakness in Argentina caused by drought conditions experienced in the first half of the year.",-1
"I have also had the opportunity to meet with several of our sales teams and I can tell you that energy levels are high with some early wins in the quarter, which set us up for a future revenue synergy opportunities.",1
"Excluding special items, our effective tax rate of 15% continues to compared favorably to our prior year rate of 17% and we did see a drop in income from ‚Äì attributable to non-controlling interest, down about $11 million compared to last year and that really just relates to the timing of the Hitachi entities as well as some underlying tax rates in those entities.",1
"Turning to slide 18, as far as Q4 guidance, is $0.86 to $0.88, which is a 13% to 16% increase versus $0.76 last year.",1
"In the usual manner, we will be in three parts; the highlights of the year 2014, I will do that, and our CFO, Thomas Toepfer, will give you the financial update, and after that, we'll have the outlook and after we are done with our formal presentation, we'll turn it back over to you for Q&A.",0
"The second thing is, and we alluded to that a little bit in our press statement, is we will continue very hard to work on our self-help efforts that is containing our fixed cost development, especially in Western Europe.",0
"Although a sales decrease in Indonesia was already accounted for as sales was high in the first quarter last year, results went below expectations.",-1
"Sales increased by ¬•136.1 billion from the corresponding period a year ago supported by increased sales volume and price hikes at  conventional Komatsu (00:13:08), which takes up KMC as well as a higher sales volume at KMC as well.",1
"In our management team, we have several strong people, and many of them were potential candidates to be my successors.",1
"In the first half year, we've grown at about 7%, so I think that this range is very much in line with that.",1
"So here we, of course, have the volume decline, but a continued price pressure which has continued more or less at similar levels to before.",0
So clearly that's something which we can't feel happy about and we continue to take action to reverse the trend.,1
"So, we try to look at the Chinese market, my judgment would here be that overall the market has become healthier from a fundamental perspective because inventory situation has improved and we can see good continued underlying demand.",1
"But another positive news is that the growth in new construction starts was at 8.8%, so close to 10%, while in quarter one, it was still slightly negative.",1
"So we have these two areas that are impacting and we can also see that in particular Tier-1 cities, there has been a lot of restrictions imposed by the government to cool down the market overall in these cities and that we're seeing that growth has spread more to ‚Äì more Tier-2 cities and Tier-3 cities in the vicinity of Tier-1.",-1
"Then if we look at China in more detail, then our orders, measured in units, grew very slightly, but when measured in monetary value, we saw a clear growth there.",1
"And also in this context, I would like to express my thanks to our whole personnel for the job very well done.",0
"Sales grew at 6.2% in the first nine months, up to ‚Ç¨6.6 billion, and our EBIT ‚Ç¨750 million or adjusted EBIT, if we exclude the cost from the Accelerate program, little bit over ‚Ç¨792 million, and also here the margin was 12% compared to 13.9% year before.",1
"Then, if we go to ‚Äì before we actually ‚Äì before I comment the market conditions, I want to take you through the main key figures in the P&L.",0
The value of the order book at the end of March totaled approximate ‚Ç¨1.58 million which is 2.7% higher than in the previous year on a comparable currency basis.,0
"So, our networking capital at the end of the first quarter was ‚Ç¨355 million ‚Äì that is 11.4% of rolling 12-month sales.",0
"One quite important highlight is that for the first time in our history, the Service business now collected more than ‚Ç¨200 million orders in one quarter.",0
"We all know that the Eastern European situation is affecting perhaps more indirectly, it's affecting the sentiment and people are waiting with their decisions.",0
"Also, gross margin continued to develop well and we also got a little bit help from the mix, as a result of the parts business having been doing pretty well.",0
"An optimist says that there is a positive trend, a slight positive trend, which has been visible there for about perhaps a year.",1
"In the European Union area, the pace of expansion weakened sequentially with each month since the start of 2018, and the manufacturing capacity utilization rate improved slightly during the first half of the year.",-1
"And then as the last slide from me, the overall group EBIT ‚Ç¨115 million, clearly behind our targets because especially of the second quarter.",0
"And even though the order intake in the modernization side was not so good, so the deliveries from the modernization business were quite okay and that helped to boost the sales level a little bit in the fourth quarter.",0
"Likewise, weak growth in the container throughput and focus on M&A activities has affected terminal operators' appetite for capacity investments and expansions at ports.",1
The acquisition of Material Handling & Port Solution business from Terex Corporation reached very important milestones in the third quarter.,0
Our own demand environment with the industrial customer segment continue to improve in EMEA and Americas despite increased uncertainty in the world economy.,1
"Activity in the world's manufacturing sector continued to expand in Q3, although at a lowing pace reflecting the reduced predictability in the global economy.",0
We stay with the indication that we believe sales of the processing technology would be and will be in 2014 on the same level as 2013.,0
"You see on this slide, the dots you have there is the countries where we have already subsidiaries, and you see a lot of dots in Asia and one particular part is that we are going to extend our footprint with subsidiaries in Asia and in Africa.",0
"My experience with working capital it's focus, focus, focus, and this is what we are trying to illustrate on the left-hand side where the red box is.",0
"If we look at page 9, we see then here our core segment,  Product Filling and Decoration (00:12:58) segment which accounts for most of our business.",0
"So finally, at least we start to see that this is going in the right direction, but still a long way to go.",0
"If you look at the working capital on the next slide, the working capital did not change in terms of relation to the turnover.",0
"And the order intake, which we have seen in North America in 2015, so far, looks good and pleasing, so we do expect that even for some period, for next year, we do expect that the U. S. will stay on the same level, taking between 13%, 14% of the revenues.",1
Even the Middle East is quite stable in things we are doing out of the countries where you still can make business.,1
We are facing cost increases in general as also previously communicated and the price increase that we announced from 1st of May still has limited impact on our P&L for 2018.,1
"And therefore delivery times plays a less significant role and it's more workload related, and this is also why we are not expecting to achieve the same level of sales in Q4 as we were able to achieve last year.",1
So this is why you can directly see maybe the impact from the restructure provision in the personnel cost ratio.,0
"The market was not so supportive, and in this environment we were able to sustain the same level as in 2012, almost the same level with minus 3.4%.",0
"As a result and as you can see on the slide, adjusted operating margin including acquisitions was up 20 bps to come to 19.5%.",1
"As you know, profitability in the USA/Canada zone has significantly improved over the last 10 years but remains slightly below group average, and this is the reason why we have this kind of margin dilution.",1
"As a reminder, 2016 full year and the third quarter in particular represents very demanding basis for comparison in the U. S., which is the main country in this region.",0
"The table in the upper box of the slide represents Milestone organic growth per month in 2017, and it's a good illustration of how our sales growth may materially fluctuate month by month.",1
"Rest of Europe sales ‚Äì I'm moving on page eight ‚Äì up a good 6.1%, driven by good performance in many countries, both in the eastern part of Europe as well as in the western part of Europe.",1
"More particularly, about market trends, new construction continued its marked repeat whereas renovation showed better resilience
In Italy, after many years of steep decline in the market amplified by the impact of distributor de-stocking, sales were down only minus 1.2% in the first quarter of 2015.",-1
"The earnings situation of the Wire & Cable Solutions Division improved considerably, thanks to the solid performance of its operating business.",1
"Here, our operating income development benefited from the contribution from increased sales and the better performance of both divisions, which was also resulted by the reorganization and restructuring measures we implemented during the last year.",1
"In May 2016, our customer, PSA Group, presented our Wiring Systems factory in Pitesti, Romania, with its Best Plant Award.",0
"Now, in my presentation I, would like to report on the status, priorities and outlook of the Wiring Systems division.",0
"So, the key technology of LEONiQ consists mainly of four basic elements, the sensors and the cables and intelligent measuring electronics, cloud connection to save measured values and events incidence in real time and Leoni Analytics our own algorithms, which transform data into information for our customers and then derive recommendations to act.",-1
The two items I mentioned before and higher investments in capacity expansion are the main reason why liquid funds decreased year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter and came in at ‚Ç¨94 million.,-1
"In the first quarter, the more favorable borrowing terms as a result of refinancing borrower's note loans were still offset by nonrecurring expenses related to premature repayment of some of these loans.",-1
"Trade liabilities were up by approximately 12% to ‚Ç¨788 million, due to the expansion of business and exchange rate effects.",1
"The second quarter accounted for ‚Ç¨21.1 million of that figure, up from ‚Ç¨4.7 million of the corresponding 2013 period when the division incurred major restructuring costs, and was affected by the sharp drop in the price of copper towards the end of the quarter.",-1
"And combining those two, equipment services and intelligent part, we feel that that we have an unbeatable combination of the competitive advantage.",1
"And then, under these performance services, we have put all our skills and competencies, what we have in our company, to make that it is growing fast, because in Flow Control, the Flow Control organization is taking care of both the capital and services, because those are so closely linked to each other that it didn't make any sense to put all into the services organization.",0
"About half of that was planned, related to our profit improvement program and then we had a unplanned incident related to one of our customers.",-1
Even to ‚Äì means that there can be only one incident per week in the whole company so that gives the idea about the level of what does it mean in brackets.,1
"We've always said that Emerson is our benchmark in flow control, and starting to get there from profit point of view.",0
"Pasi has a long history in Pulp and Paper, but used to work for Valmet, so he knows that industry very well.",0
"It looks like that those ‚Äì next one will be postponed for the next year, so that it is more probable that they will take place during this year, the decision by the customers that they have indicated that they will delay their decision-making process a little bit.",-1
"On the equipment side, we wanted to keep ‚Äì that's still weak, with the same comments, what we did concerning the Flow Control in February, that we will come back to this issue after the second quarter.",0
"As mentioned earlier, we had to proceed with the revision of our business plan for the High Voltage activities we have in China and this resulted in an impairment for ‚Ç¨18 million.",-1
"With regard to the debt development, the important points: Over the rolling 12 months, we have a decrease of the debt.",-1
"And then in H2, the savings plans are going to kick in and lead to restructuring and restructuring costs also.",-1
"And one example put into place in the last three years is that, every year we have one Safety Day where the 25,000 employees on the same day dedicate the day to improving safety, including the whole management and all people working in support functions and in the offices.",0
We were not that lucky and that accounts for the biggest variation that we have between H1 last year and H1 this year.,0
"So, we succeeded in this challenge and the second half year should be much better versus this previous second half year of the last year, which was difficult.",1
We develop our own automation for production cable lines and began the ‚Äì there's a very efficient program in North America.,1
"So, again, we continue to work on the liquidity profile of the group, and we continue to stick to our promise to reduce their base debt to gross debt of the group.",-1
"And there you can see that, we had in the first nine months of 2017, a material cost ratio of 41%, 40.9% in Q3.",0
I think we have proven over the last years that we actually are able to come up with sustainable margins with our business model.,1
So this is the assumption included of a euro U. S. dollar currency exchange rates similar to what we have right now.,0
"With the outlook for 2017, as I mentioned before, we are confirming our guidance and I like to ‚Äì vis-√†-vis our guidance for 2017, we expecting moderate organic growth of around 1% to 2%, 3% and additional sales of ‚Ç¨45 million coming from the acquisitions of Autoline and Lifial.",1
"One is FX, from ‚Ç¨473 million to ‚Ç¨453 million, and I just explained that our working capital went up, so cash flow came down a little bit, so that there's a nice increase in net debt.",-1
"Overall, we are pleased with the positive development of the Surface Solutions Segment, which continued to be the main revenue and income generator for the group, delivering strong results in the second quarter for the year.",1
"We delivered a double-digit EBITDA of 13.6% or 11% when excluding the one-offs and here again a slight hint, most probably not the run rate for the coming years.",0
"As a whole, the group had a book-to-bill ratio of above 1 for six consecutive quarter, and EBITDA margin of 13.4%.",0
"And I had to say, sorry, Manmade Fibers is a specific technology I do not have a certain capability there to understand but I have an engineering background to learn the same as on Roland Fischer side.",0
"And I was eight years in Siemens, and eight years in BMW, and in between in Porsche, and so on.",0
"Driving forces, very continued strong demand which we have seen out of China, in particular for Oerlikon's leading WINGS technology in the Filament yarn's spinning, as well as some exceptional demand which arose out of the U. S. for BCF carpet yarn equipment which were obviously favorably impacting intake at the overall results.",1
We took over a minority stake with the option to acquire a majority interest within the next three years and closing was done in two or three weeks.,-1
"So we gained market share, we already had a strong market share, but now we are able to gain also additional market share because our competitors are not able to produce in Russia.",1
"I continue on page number 9, diversifications done, this is what the main, main strategic pillar within the last 10 to 15 years.",0
"PALFINGER has a very long history, a very traditional company with a high success especially in active boom cranes until the year 2000.",1
We have to mention here that this could have been even better because we had quite some backlog at the year-end which was also one of the reasons for the profit running at the end of last year.,1
"And again, I have to highlight that we ‚Äì on top of that, we had a substantial backlog which has been shifted into 2018.",1
"And we also had one-off effects due to the fact that Herbert Ortner left the company and also, of course, the backlog was impacting the EBITn by about ‚Ç¨6 million.",0
"In the first quarter of 2016, we have generated a little bit more than 60% of our sales in EMEA; nearly 24% of our sales in Americas; so in Americas, we are getting closer to our target of one-third; and around 15% in Asia Pacific and CIS.",0
"So, we are decreasing gearing ratio, and thanks to a very strong operative cash flow, we will see a further decrease in the next few months.",1
"There, we had a very big start because of very strong winter in North America, so we reported a loss in the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter  banking (15:46) profitability with 3% EBIT margin in the AREA UNITS, which were not the area where we'd like to be, but we see the potential.",-1
"So, this is the focus today, to take care of areas where we are not as profitable as we should be to harmonize processes to prepare for a global launch of an SAP system for every single company.",1
Margins decreased 430 basis points and this includes the higher non-recurring engineering charges that we've been talking about and the higher OEM business versus the aftermarket.,-1
"And just to remind everyone, these numbers represented trailing average and they‚Äôre reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, of course excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency.",1

"Despite ongoing weakness in our end markets this quarter, we were able to achieve total segment operating margins of 14.8% or 15.6% adjusted.",1
"Cash flow was strong in the quarter and also the year, with cash flow from operations excluding the discretionary pension contribution exceeding 12% of sales reflecting the stability of our cash generation during the downturn.",1
"So, in summary, by executing the new Win Strategy, we are confident we will achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020.",1
The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $60 million or 1% of sales for the full year.,-1
"CLARCOR acquisition-related expenses were $16 million in Q2, $51 million in Q3, and are expected to be $36 million during Q4.",0

"First quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings per share have been adjusted by a total of $0.05, including business realignment expenses of $0.01 and CLARCOR cost to achieve of $0.04.",1
"Because today, the lesson we got from the market is that we can do ‚Äì we are able to do ‚Äì we have not issues to realize it, but we need to be careful with the customer service.",1
"We have enjoyed in this first quarter, the famous France-Italy project that is going well quite fast and that's a very good sign.",1
"We expect the Energy Projects, we have the order book and consequently, it's a matter of execution to realize a very good Energy Projects and Telecom full year.",1
"Energy Projects, obviously we considered the ‚Ç¨20 million provision release and we think that should be enough to cover the problem we had in the  district (00:23:10).",-1
"So we are growing in terms of sales, but we are not growing in terms of EBITDA, that's simply because of the mix of the subs businesses.",0
"On the other side, the Middle East especially OCI, is suffering a lot because with the oil at a so cheap price, there is no way for the local economies to ramp up significantly.",-1
"Telecom, Telecom is a very peculiar case because in the first half posted an acceleration that was almost brutal with the 13% of organic growth especially in the second quarter.",1
The speed of the organic growth in the third quarter was substantially similar ‚Äì substantially unchanged compared to the first half with an organic growth of 6.6% in the third quarter versus 7% in the first half.,1
"This number has not changed, but the foreseeable further losses, to reach the ‚Ç¨167 million we announced it to the market.",0
"And of course, we enjoyed a less positive effect, which is the affect of lower volumes and thus slightly lower metal price as well.",1
"Let's have a look at page 7 of the EBITDA bridge of the first half 2017 versus the first half 2018, but the contrary, first half 2018 versus first half 2017.",0
"And as Valerio commented, the net financial position closed slightly above ‚Ç¨3 billion, also benefiting from this onetime or temporary effect on tax payable which is quite significant because it amounts to ‚Ç¨70 million.",-1
"Then ‚Ç¨1.215 billion related to the refinancing of General Cable debt, a positive inflow referring to the EBITDA, close to ‚Ç¨300 million to the reported EBITDA, an increase of working capital close to ‚Ç¨300 million, and then the CapEx for approximately ‚Ç¨100 million, the financial charges paid for ‚Ç¨39 million, the taxes paid for ‚Ç¨45 million, and the dividends, of course, for ‚Ç¨103 million.",1
"The margin increase is attributable to many of the same factors I talked about for the company as a whole, but additionally, Q2 last year was a relatively low margin quarter for Architecture and Software, so also a somewhat easy comparison.",1
"On the left side of the chart, Architecture & Software segment sales were $674 million in Q2, down 1.8% compared to Q2 last year.",0
"With that starting point, even with projected IP growth next year, we don't expect sufficient sequential growth in the balance of 2016 to get us to a positive organic growth result for the year.",1
"Without that extension, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 would have been pretty close to our previous full-year tax rate guidance of 27%.",1
"Orders in our solutions and services businesses in this segment were up year-over-year, and we are pleased with a strong book-to-bill performance of 1.17% in Q2.",1
This has been very successful and 2012 is a place where we've invested and started to deliver very significantly on this front.,1
"The U. S., of course, and that is the biggest impact, but we also have seen some improvement in Mexico which started the year with a lot of difficulty and which improved in Q4.",1
"Well, we've been impacted by a tough market in Western Europe and also tough market in Asia, impacted also by our lower exposure to North America in this sector.",-1
"And as you know, we are implementing a specialized organization for everything we do in systems, which is projects and equipment, to have a more streamlined, a more agile, a more decisive management for that part of the business.",0
"You combine the two and you're coming up with a strong set of results, where we are able to combine accelerated top line growth and margin improvement.",1
"North America, plus 3% for H2, but the good news is that we have seen a clear acceleration at plus 6% of the business in North America in Q4 ‚Äì still good situation in residential, clear improvement in commercial and industrial building.",1
"But we've been doing pretty well in Low Voltage, even in Industrial Automation in the first half of the year in the United Kingdom.",0
"And for the second part of the year, after a negative ‚Ç¨570 million on the top line, we only expect, if I may say, between ‚Ç¨100 million and ‚Ç¨200 million negative for H2.",-1
"Well, it's been contrasted by ‚Äì it's been quite consistent, I would say, by business, except in Infrastructure, where most of the selectivity is playing.",0
"As we look to the second part of the year, we see some positives like we see a continuous momentum in the U. S. construction.",1
"Also to be mentioned that in conformity with what we announced in Schneider is On, we are going to keep going with the buyback program, ‚Ç¨1 billion to ‚Ç¨1.5 billion by 2016.",0
"But when we look at infrastructure today at Medium Voltage, if I want to speak the language of technology, you have two parts.",0
"But what we have seen in May, mid-May and overall in June is a significant depreciation of currency in the emerging country.",0
I said that there were a couple of unusual items in the quarter that reduced our funds from operations and our GAAP cash flow or cash flow from operating activities.,0
"Starting with last year's profit before tax of ¬£445 million, we have separated out the one-off effect of the ¬£30 million of charges in Smiths Detection last year.",0
"Investments in China are taking much longer to pay off, but we are delivering strong growth in other emerging markets.",1
"We are targeting cost savings to fund this investment, but these savings were obscured in the first half, in part by some one-off costs.",0
"Moving to the balance sheet and first turning to pensions, you will see the net deficit has fallen since last year, giving a movement from ¬£238 million to ¬£382 million.",1
"But aftermarket revenues returned to growth in the first half, up 3% as levels of activity stabilized, although, at this stage, first-fit contract activity showed no signs of recovery.",1
"The rolling average is used as our performance measure, and that ensures that we don't encourage window dressing at period ends.",0
"We made further progress derisking the pension liabilities in the first half of this year with two further buy ins for the UK schemes, one for SIPS, one for TI, and that covers more than ¬£300 million of liabilities.",1
"But even excluding these contracts, revenue still increased and now represents 27% of divisional sales, close to our target of 30%.",1
"And I believe that creating a more inclusive environment is the foundation of innovative thinking as we seek to attract, retain, develop, engage and inspire the very best people.",1
Our focus on accelerating top line growth will be underpinned by additional funding and more effective execution of new product development.,1
"Operating profit of ¬£247 million was down 11% or 2% on an underlying basis after adjusting for restructuring and pension admin costs, which as previously promised, are now treated as headline items.",-1
"The growth investments, some field cost inefficiency and preparation for increased growth in the second half, the European volume headwinds and the impact of the temporary impact of the distributor model shift in the mechanical business and that basically results from, still having the same or similar cost to serve that we had, when we had a direct model, but taking a slightly lower gross margin in order to run through the distributor channel.",1
"This represents clear market share gains stemming from both new listings at retailers and distributors, as well as a deluge of NPI including great success with the XI brushless cordless product, as well as multi tools and steam products.",1
That leverage ‚Äì leveraging target ‚Äì deleveraging targets were met and we took a modest step towards our $1 billion share repurchase program in Q4.,0
This assumption change is more about the impact of recasting our reporting segments than it is a change in business assumptions since January.,0
"In summary, it was a solid operational performance by the Industrial teams, holding organic growth flat and expanding the operating margin rate despite soft infrastructure in Global Industrial markets as well as a significant currency drag.",1
"In summary, for the total company, the fourth quarter represented a solid performance wrapping up a tremendous year which included organic growth of 6%, record operating margins, and record EPS.",1
"Another set of factors to be aware of in industrial is that we expect the North American automotive business to reflect the slowing market as we end 2016, combined with a weak Oil & Gas pipeline construction market in Q4.",-1
"We are extremely pleased with the segment's outperformance this quarter, as both the Engineered Fastening and Infrastructure businesses delivered positive organic growth in excess of expectations.",1
"You know, how do you think you balance those two and maybe what is normalized margin trajectory for the Tools & Storage business?",0
"That growth, along with cost and asset efficiency from functional transformation and core SFS, enabled us to continue to make targeted investments to support future innovation, growth, and margin expansion.",1
"And I'm confident that we will bring the same level of passion, intensity and agility that we demonstrated in the first half to successfully deliver the second half, thus producing another great year for Stanley Black & Decker.",1
"On slide 12, next slide, you'd see that orders rebounded sequentially in H1 over H2 last year and also quarter-on-quarter.",1
"It's a difficult move, it's a painful move, but it's a necessary one in an area, where we run it really competitive.",-1
"We introduced our Demag brand of mobile cranes to North America, we highlighted our Genie XC booms, and our MP segment launched the new EvoQuip models in our crushing and screening line.",1
"And lastly, the other category mainly reflects a reduction in the amount of LCs issued and outstanding under the company's revolving credit facility.",1
"The improved backlog, which is up 34% versus the prior year, combined with substantial restructuring efforts that are underway and mostly impacting 2014 make us optimistic about the ongoing contribution from this group.",1
"We did end the month of June fairly strong, accounting for our modestly better results versus the $0.50 to $0.60 EPS range that was anticipated.",1
"We've said from the first quarter restructuring charges, we get about 75% of that in 2016, and we're still holding to that.",0
"But, overall, the business ‚Äì port is been tough with the container traffic, so we've had a decrease in port business order intake.",-1
"If you couple this with the anticipated margin expansion and a disciplined capital deployment approach, we have a lot more value opportunity to capture internally.",1
We will post a replay of this call on the Terex website under Events & Presentations in the Investor Relations section.,0
We're making positive change in that business including the recent launch of a new modular Demag rope hoist that you can see pictured on this page.,1
We continue to see demand for port equipment below expectations with the exception of the mobile harbor crane that is gaining some momentum but after a weak first quarter.,-1
"Finally, our design and engineering teams around the world are focusing on making our products simpler, so they're less expensive and easier to manufacture and, importantly, providing greater quality, ease of use and return on investment to our customers.",1
"We are making progress addressing the operational challenges in cranes, our backlog is up in every segment and most of our global markets are strong.",1
Please note that details associated with the adjustments can be found in the appendix of the presentation including the income statement line items against which they were applied.,-1
"Over 100 customers from around the world attended and provided outstanding feedback on our new flattop crane, pictured here, including the new elevator, anti-collision system, and the new telematics solution.",1
"Also, these acquisitions, we have managed to do the acquisitions, conclude acquisition of Schwab Vibration, which is substantially improving our position.",1
"But once again generally a very positive view on Wheel Systems, moving in the right direction, feel very confident on the integration of Mitas into Trelleborg running very well  (18:27).",1
"If I look then on the developments, you can see then that we have 19 consecutive quarters with the improved numbers, improved EBIT.",1
"Of course, there are pockets which has severely hit, let's say, the drilling segment, by the way, in other segments in oil and gas still have quite healthy order books.",1
"But, of course, also on the flip side of this coin is also some benefits that we have, let's say, benefiting hopefully the global economy that we have lower oil prices and also some benefit in lower raw materials, also if we believe to capture.",1
"Overall then, supporting this, of course, is a structure growth that is two months basically of benefit coming from Archer and Uretek which is kicking in here on the sales and creating this good structure growth.",1
"And if you take in Asia and other markets, as Peter mentioned, we have good growth in China, slightly down in Australia, which is  (25:58).",1
"I mean, this is the full and total results of the group within the quarter impacted by substantial one-off a year ago and one-off positives a year ago, one-off negatives this year.",0
"Also, with satisfaction, we see that TrelleborgVibracoustic continues to develop according to plan with good safe development and improve profitability.",1
Slide 32 describes the return on equity where the long-term target is 12% of continuous operation including items affecting comparability.,0
"All in all, reported sales increased some 24%, mainly driven by CGS acquisition, but overall a good market position, continue to benefit from good market positions, good cost control, of course, the acquisitions benefiting, it managed to deliver the highest EBIT so far for Trelleborg.",1
"CapEx, not sticking out, even though we guided for the full year that we're going to have an uptick in CapEx, which still is the guidance, but nevertheless,  individually in (07:16) the quarter, there is nothing really that's picking out compared to last year.",0
"I mean, as we move into better positions where we're also gaining a better, more value creation towards our customers, and thereby also being able to utilize these benefits.",1
"As Peter mentioned, you can see the impact on the agriculture part in Trelleborg Wheel System, which overall reports minus 9%.",0
"And on top of that, we have also TrelleborgVibracoustic, our joint venture company, which is delivering the EBIT margin at 8.9%, is also the highest so far.",1
"Honestly, in the beginning of the quarter, we expect the level actually to be slightly weaker, but it picked up fairly good end of the quarter.",1
"Moving over to TrelleborgVibracoustic, and this is of course, just to remind those of you this is a business in creation.",0
"And we also, in the quarter, if you look for some negatives, we also have a little bit low deliveries in the quarter in aerospace, but we don't believe that is kind of on the back of any, let's say, bad underlying demand.",0
"As you can see, a variation among our business areas, very good performance in Trelleborg Sealing Solution and a bit slower in Trelleborg Coated Systems.",0
"So, we're putting up a new factory in Denver to replace an old one we have in Denver as well in order to really make sure that we continue to deliver the best products and the best service to our customers.",1
"Looking at this then I'll get it in ‚Äì Ulf will get back on this, but nevertheless quickly and to see how this goes into the figures.",0
"Then we also then included that we have two optional years, so we can increase it with another two years so it's up to 2020.",1
"So we have a mixed picture here, and we still feel that the market conditions going forward, although with a positive view, much more, I say, a firmly more positive view going in here to 2014 when we were going into 2013, but nevertheless, we are not fully comfortable, and internally in the company we still focus a lot in internal cost control and making sure that we control the pricing and make sure that we continue to benefit from the market positions going forward.",1
"I already highlighted a few of those quarter, robust sales up total by 14% driven by a slight negative 1% organic.",-1
And we have to look at this even though we have some-20% of sales or something of the group exposed to the fairly depressed market of agriculture and oil and gas.,-1
"We don't really see an improvement yet, but at least we're getting the feeling that is not really continuing down and we're then looking with, yeah, some more positive view actually here going into 2017 for that market.",1
"That said, I also want to highlight then that we have ‚Äì if you look in individual business areas, we have Coated Systems which is 19% up in profit; Industrial Solutions is up 19%, Sealing Solutions is up 21%, and Wheels is up 25%.",1
"And this is very much driven about from the cruising industry, somewhat from the offshore, but also from the gas-fueled vessels.",0
"And you remember, we used to be at the level of 2% market share and now it's 20%, so extremely good development and, of course, good support when the merchant market starts picking up.",1
"Looking at the market outlook, I think the overall market for Power Plants is expected to be similar as 2012.",0
"If we look at the marine market and what's happening actually there, there's a lot of new vessels coming to the market.",0
"On the Ship Power side, the main drivers is supporting activity in the shipping and the offshore sector are in place.",0
I expect net CapEx in the region of ¬£120 million in 2014 driven by the recently announced Malaysian investment as well as significant improvements in our IT infrastructure.,1
"This is slightly higher than the ¬£45 million anticipated back in November, as we've responded to deteriorating market conditions in the Oil & Gas Division.",1
"In terms of working capital, we generated a cash inflow of ¬£39 million in the period compared to an outflow of $79 million in the prior year.",0
"Secondly, again as noted in February, the lull in GEHO revenues of ¬£25 million and associated under-recoveries had a ¬£5 million profit impact.",0
"While oil prices were relatively volatile in the period, the average for WTI through the first six months was $50 per barrel, and we saw no let up in demand through the various troughs with both pressure pumping and pressure control seeing strong sequential growth from Q1 to Q2.",1
"And lastly, by investing in our four distinctive competencies now, we can achieve sustainable long-term growth ahead of our markets and deliver stronger returns for our investors in the future.",1
"On the other hand, aftermarket revenues were up 27% and 15% like-for-like, with good sequential growth through the period in pressure pumping and a strong performance from the service businesses.",1
"Latin America, for instance, has benefited from a ramp-up to full production of a number of large mine projects, including Las Bambas in Peru reaching full commercial production.",1
"Having delivered 47% growth in profit before tax in 2017, we believe we are well placed to deliver further strong growth and de-leveraging in 2018.",1
"Internationally, we did see an initial pickup in activity in the Middle East but competition and therefore pricing remains fierce.",0
"As proud as we are of our organic innovation, we also appreciate that collaborating with others allows the group to accelerate our strategic initiatives.",1
"And at Escondida in Chile, the world's largest copper mine, BHP expects grades to decline by almost 30% in 2016 alone.",-1
"But along with the pressure on competitors, our customers are suffering, too, with the 30% reduction in the North American service industry.",1
We are expecting operating income to grow 12% year-over-year and operating margins to expand greater than 100 basis points as standardization and synergy benefits continue to accelerate.,1
"Over the full year, we're expecting $7.4 billion in revenue, up 1% to 2% organically year-over-year, reflecting near record bottom levels of projects in Australia, Canadian oil sands and EMEA as well as the absorption of a global industrial slowdown in slow large Greenfield sites globally.",-1
This does include 20 million of OMT investment which is an important component of reducing the overall complexity of our Valves & Controls business and lower G&A but also contributing to long term improvement in the overall tax rate of the Pentair enterprise.,1
"We delivered on our first half expectations as operating income grew 15%, despite only a 1% gain on the top line.",1
"Water Quality Systems once again had a solid quarter with 3% core sales growth, though lower than the 6% core growth last quarter.",1
We thought it would be helpful to provide an update on our Valves & Controls business and the further deteriorating conditions in this space since issuing our initial 2006 guidance last December.,-1
"Given the strong start to free cash flow this year, we feel good about our ability to deliver approximately $750 million in free cash this year.",1
This is important to mention because the pool season heated up in March this year as opposed to April a year ago resulting a tough comparison in the second quarter.,-1
"As a reminder our thermal business is facing a nearly $100 million top line headwind in 2017, as three large jobs from 2016 were completed.",0
Aquatic Systems delivered robust 10% core sales growth in the quarter and income grew 7% while ROS contracted 50 basis points.,1
"While the revenue declines were fairly broad-based and not restricted to any one country, from a regional perspective the most significant headwinds were in Europe.",-1
"Taken together the low growth economic environment along with relative stability of demand for the critical type of products we sell across a variety of end markets, we expect flat to up low single-digit market growth with Xylem in the range of up 1% to 3% organically.",1
This outlook is improved relative to our original expectations and reflects the positive performance realized over the first half and our project backlog over the balance of the year.,1
"And then, I would say something that I've spoken a lot about and that as I see consistently across the company.",0
"We generated a strongest growth in the emerging markets over the course of the year, where we posted a 13% increase.",1
"We delivered 9% growth in emerging markets, including double-digit growth in industrial water applications in the Middle East and Latin America.",1
Residential should grow in the low- to mid-single-digit range driven by strength in the U. S. albeit at lower levels as seen in 2015.,1
"Collectively, global procurement, Lean and Six Sigma activities and restructuring savings reduced our cost by $30 million in the quarter, resulting in 320 basis points of margin improvement.",-1
Partially offsetting these savings were cost inflation of a 170 basis points and the funding of our strategic growth initiatives of 90 basis points.,1
"Our Middle East business declined 28% during the quarter reflecting both the timing of large prior year project deliveries as well as a further slowdown in the region.
China was down 4% year-over-year and in line with our expectations.",-1
We also delivered solid improvement in free cash flow year-over-year and continue to be well positioned to deliver full year free cash flow conversion in excess of 110% of net income.,1

"I look forward to our upcoming Investor Conference on February 27 where along with our leadership team, we will update you on 2014 guidance and our actions to continue to drive shareholder value.",1
The remaining $0.04 per share was incremental to our guidance based primarily on the continued strength of the U. S. dollar against major currencies.,-1
The decline in Vending Solutions was driven by lower sales to certain U. S. bottlers and weak market conditions in Europe.,-1
"As Max mentioned, we are reducing our 2015 EPS guidance, excluding special items, to a range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share from our prior range of $4.30 to $4.50 per share.",0

"To refresh, activity dropped off toward the end of 2015 and our guidance set for 2016 was consistent with our fourth quarter run rate.",-1
"Despite good revenue growth, the product mix was unfavorable compared to prior year, and material cost pressures rose during the quarter.",-1
"Segment operating profit of $20 million increased 95% from $10 million last year, primarily as a result of the MEI acquisition.",1

"It was a solid first quarter with growth in every segment and every region of the world, and good performance in both developed and emerging economies.",1
As we turn to look at the full year of 2018 after having posted double-digit organic growth in 2017 we know that our comps are difficult throughout the year.,-1
"In the quarter, capital expenditures were $10 million, dividends paid totaled $18 million, and share repurchases, net of shares issued, totaled $34 million.",0
"Debt, including notes payable, totaled $819 million at the end of the quarter, with approximately $500 million of debt repaid subsequent to quarter end.",0
"The lower full-year 2013 tax rate of 27% as compared to the 31.5% rate in 2012 reflects the higher level of dividends received from the Liquid Finishing businesses and the Federal R&D tax credit that was renewed in 2013, effective retroactive to the beginning of 2012.",1
"In the Americas, the Contractor segment should grow double digit for the full year, but the rate of growth will decelerate from 2013 as we're up against tougher comps.",0

"We just needed to demonstrate that we can do what we were planning to do and get caught up on price, which I think we are well on track to do.",1
"I think the other point that I would make is, as we look at the year, and certainly the bigger risks are in the second half of the year, depending on how the harsh and hazardous plays out.",-1
"The operating margin of 13.2% compares unfavorably to prior year, and Dave described for you a little bit how we've got some mix headwinds and the biggest contributor is the fact of high voltage test equipment and Harsh & Hazardous businesses having ‚Äì which come with very high margins, coming with lower sales this quarter.",-1

"Our adjusted operating margins increased significantly year-over-year to 12.8% in the current quarter, up from 7.8% in the prior year quarter.",1
"The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate was driven primarily by the favorable impact in the prior year quarter related to a U. S. provision to return adjustments that did not repeat in the current year, partially offset by earnings in the U. S. that cannot be tax affected in the current year.",1
"In summary, the increase in adjusted EPS year-over-year reflects incremental restructuring benefits, higher fixed-cost absorption and productivity, the positive effects of lower raw material costs and sales volume growth, partially offset by a higher tax rate, the negative impacts of unfavorable mix, price and higher performance-based compensation increase, as well as some unfavorable currency exchange of $0.05 per share.",-1

"During the quarter, we returned $54 million to shareholders through the repurchase of nearly 1 million shares and the payment of our quarterly dividend.",0

"From the North American perspective in light vehicle, industry production declined almost 3%, but we did note that mix was holding up particularly well.",1
"I would say, the key message really is that customers are continuing to march very strongly towards adoption of hybrids and electrics, particularly with some of the regulatory uncertainty out there, all of the automakers are realizing the need to balance mix in their fleet between combustion, hybrid and electric and that's naturally we're working very closely with them.",0

"We shipped 16,000 units to the North America medium-duty truck market this quarter, an increase of 38% year over year.",1
We've reduced head count in our European operations there and also moved some of our production into lower cost plants so we've done quite a bit of work.,0

"No, no, that ‚Äì I just wanted to be sure, but listen you've ‚Äì I think you've actually capsulized it very well, if you ‚Äì you look at the market and you look at our overall volume as a company excluding Venezuela, we grew the 3% which is really pretty much in line with what we said, strong volumes in Asia and EMEA, when you come back and you look at the Americas, and you adjust again for Venezuela and then the GDTNA piece, what you see is Brazil was the weak spot in the Americas and then you come down to kind of the U. S. if you like, if you want to call it, that you hit it on the head, we're about flat.",-1
"So I think as you look at Q1, you've got a little bit of a seasonal impact in there as well.",0

"Our outlook in military and cement moves remains uncertain, but if we continue to see the volumes similar to what we're seeing currently, then it's possible we'll have quarterly growth in this part of the business as well.",1
The challenge at the end of year planned schedules may be mitigated to some extent due to the heavy demand for replacement cars and trucks in the area impacted by hurricanes and earthquakes.,-1
This segment will also see the largest benefit as congestion eases and a normal operating environment returns in Northern Mexico.,1
"Moving to coal, the loss of a customer contract at the beginning of the year will continue to impact volumes.",-1

"This is much lower than we were expecting but it again reflects the impact of lower coffee prices, slower global category growth and a Q4 revenue decline in Asia-Pacific largely due to China.",-1
"That said, when we laid out our long-term revenue growth target over a year ago our categories were growing about 6%.",1
"Pricing was only a modest contributor, mainly due to the impact from coffee, as we passed through lower green costs to our customers.",0

"And that's why we have such a broad set of initiatives this year, from strengthening our existing platforms with renovation on kid and original style Yoplait, new Greek Whips, and a significant product improvement on Greek 100, to building new segments in organic, beverages, desserts and snacking.",1
